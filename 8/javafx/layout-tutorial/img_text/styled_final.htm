<p>This figure is a screen shot. At the top of the screen is a bar with a horizontal, rectangular button labeled "Current" followed by a similar button labeled "Projected" on the left side of the bar. On the right side of the bar is a smaller rectangle with a question mark in it. Below the buttons on the left side of the screen is a column of five rows of text strings: "Data", "Sales", "Marketing", "Distribution", and "Costs".</p>
<p>To the right of the text strings is a grid showing a house icon and the title "Sales: Current Year". The subtitle "Goods and Services" is under the title. Under the subtitle is a pie chart that is 80% blue, which represents goods, and 20% pink, which represents services. The string "Goods 80%" appears to the lower left of the pie chart. The string "Services 20%" appears to the upper right of the pie chart.</p>
<p>To the right of the grid are eight icons arranged in four rows of two icons each. The first row contains an icon numbered 1 with the image of a pie chart followed by an icon numbered 2 with the image of a line graph. The second row contains an icon numbered 3 with an image of a bar chart followed by an icon numbered 4 with an image of a page with five horizontal bars on it. The third row contains an icon numbered 5 with an image of a globe followed by an icon numbered 6 with the image of an area chart. The fourth row contains an icon numbered 7 with the image of a flow chart followed by an icon numbered 8 with the image or a high-low graph.</p>
<p>Below the string "Services 20%" and aligned with the bottom row of the rows of icons are two horizontal, rectangular buttons side-by-side. The first button is labeled "Save" and the second button is labeled "Cancel". Approximately 50% of the screen between the grid and the buttons is empty space.</p>
