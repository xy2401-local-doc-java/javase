<p>This figure is a screen shot that shows two tabs at the top. The first tab is labeled "Sizing" and the second tab is labeled "Alignment". The Alignment tab is selected and shows three rows in the center of the screen. The first row contains the label "User name" followed by an empty entry field. The second row contains the label "Password" followed by an empty entry field. The third row contains three buttons arranged horizontally. The first button is labeled "Submit"; the second button is labeled "Clear"; and the third button is labeled "Exit". The font for the Submit button is bigger than the font for the other buttons, which makes the Submit button approximately 30% bigger in height than the Clear and Exit buttons. The bottoms of the buttons are aligned.</p>
