<p>This figure is a screen shot that shows two tabs at the top. The first tab is labeled "Sizing" and the second tab is labeled "Alignment". The Sizing tab is selected and shows a box that represents a <code>ListView</code> control. The <code>ListView</code> control takes up approximately three quarters of the width of the screen and approximately 80% of the height of the screen and contains 17 rows that alternate between white and light gray. Row 1 contains the string "Hot dog". Row 2 contains the string "Hamburger". Row 3 contains the string "French fries". Row 4 contains the string "Carrot sticks". Row 5 contains the string "Chicken salad". The remaining rows are blank.</p>
<p>To the right of the <code>ListView</code> control are four buttons arranged vertically. The first button is labeled "Add"; the second button is labeled "Delete"; the third button is labeled "Move Up"; and the last button is labeled "Move Down". The buttons are different widths with the width being determined by the length of the label.</p>
<p>Below the <code>ListView</code> control are three buttons arranged horizontally. The first button is labeled "Apply"; the second button is labeled "Continue"; and the last button is labeled "Exit". The buttons are different widths with the width being determined by the length of the label. The font for the Exit button is bigger than the font for the other buttons, which makes the Exit button approximately 30% bigger in height than the Apply and Continue buttons.</p>
