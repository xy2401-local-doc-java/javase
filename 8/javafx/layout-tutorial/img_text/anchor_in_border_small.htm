<p>This figure is a smaller version of the screen shot in <a href="../builtin_layouts.htm#BABJBJCB">Figure 1-13</a>, to show that as the screen size is reduced, the buttons move up. The result is a slate blue bar with a horizontal, rectangular button labeled "Current" followed by a similar button labeled "Projected" on the left side of the bar. On the right side of the bar is a smaller rectangle with a question mark in it.</p>
<p>Below the buttons on the left side of the screen is a column of five rows of text strings: "Data", "Sales", "Marketing", "Distribution", and "Costs". To the right of the text strings is a grid showing a house icon and the title "Sales: Current Year". The subtitle "Goods and Services" is under the title. Under the subtitle is a pie chart that is 80% blue, which represents goods, and 20% pink, which represents services. The string "Goods 80%" appears to the lower left of the pie chart. The string "Services 20%" appears to the upper right of the pie chart.</p>
<p>To the right of the grid are the eight icons arranged in four rows of two icons each from the flow pane in <a href="../builtin_layouts.htm#CHDCACIE">Figure 1-10</a>. Only three of the rows are showing.</p>
<p>Below the string "Services 20%" and aligned with the third row of icons are two horizontal, rectangular buttons side-by-side. The first button is labeled "Save" and the second button is labeled "Cancel". Approximately 20% of the screen between the grid and the buttons is white space.</p>
