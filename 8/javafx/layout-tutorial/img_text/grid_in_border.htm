<p>This figure is a screen shot that shows the grid pane from <a href="../builtin_layouts.htm#CHDFCFAE">Figure 1-8</a> added to the center region of the border pane shown in <a href="../builtin_layouts.htm#CHDBIFEH">Figure 1-5</a>. The top row of buttons are as described for <a href="../builtin_layouts.htm#CHDJGBDJ">Figure 1-7</a>. The result is a slate blue bar with a horizontal, rectangular button labeled "Current" followed by a similar button labeled "Projected" on the left side of the bar. On the right side of the bar is a smaller rectangle with a question mark in it.</p>
<p>Below the buttons on the left side of the screen is a column of five rows of text strings: "Data", "Sales", "Marketing", "Distribution", and "Costs". To the right of the text strings is a grid showing a house icon and the title "Sales: Current Year". The subtitle "Goods and Services" is under the title. Under the subtitle is a pie chart that is 80% blue, which represents goods, and 20% pink, which represents services. The string "Goods 80%" appears to the lower left of the pie chart. The string "Services 20%" appears to the upper right of the pie chart.</p>
