<p>This figure is an image of a screen that is divided into the five regions of a border pane. The top region spans the width of the screen and is approximately 20% of the height of the screen. The label "Top" is centered in the region and the bottom of the region is marked by a dashed horizontal line.</p>
<p>The bottom region spans the width of the screen and is approximately 20% of the height of the screen. The label "Bottom" is centered in the region and the top of the region is marked by a dashed horizontal line.</p>
<p>The left region extends from the top region to the bottom region and is approximately 25% of the width of the screen. The label "Left" is centered in the region and the right side of the region is marked by a solid vertical line that connects perpendicularly to the dashed horizontal lines of the top and bottom regions.</p>
<p>The right region extends from the top region to the bottom region and is approximately 25% of the width of the screen. The label "Right" is centered in the region and the left side of the region is marked by a solid vertical line that connects perpendicularly to the dashed horizontal lines of the top and bottom regions.</p>
<p>The center region is the middle area bounded by the other regions. The label "Center" is centered in the region.</p>
