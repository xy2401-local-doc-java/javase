<p>This illustration shows four rows with a progress bar and progress indicator in each row. From top to bottom, the first row contains the progress controls in the indeterminate mode with their values set to -1.0. The second row shows the progress controls when both values are set to 0.0. The third row shows a progress bar and progress indicator when their values are set to 0.6. The progress bar shows the 60% progress as a blue stripe. The progress indicator shows 60% of the pie filled with blue. The fourth row shows progress controls when both values are 1.0 and the operation is completed. The progress stripe spans the entire length of the progress bar, and the progress indicator is completely filled with blue. A symbol check mark is superimposed on the progress indicator.</p>
