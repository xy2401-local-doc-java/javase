<p>This illustration shows two states of a label with the wrapped text. The left image is a label in its original state. The text is rendered in three lines. The first line is "A label that." The second line contains "needs to be." And the third line contains the word "wrapped." The caption under that image says: "Mouse is off."</p>
<p>The right image shows the same label, but it is scaled by 1.5. The text is rendered in three lines and the word distribution remains the same as on the left image. However, the text looks larger, and there is a mouse cursor on top of it. The caption under that image says: "Mouse is on."</p>
