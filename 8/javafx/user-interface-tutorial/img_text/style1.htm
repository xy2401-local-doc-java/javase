<p>A sample user interface that illustrates how a style sheet is used to provide the look for the UI. The style sheet defines the background color as gold and the UI controls as a lighter gold. The font for the controls is a sans-serif font in black.</p>
<p>In the upper left corner are three radio buttons aligned vertically. These buttons are labeled High, Medium, and Low. The High button is selected. Next to the radio buttons are two text fields aligned vertically. The top text box includes the text "Your name". The bottom text box includes the text "Your password". Next to the bottom text box is a drop-down list box labeled English.</p>
<p>Below the radio buttons, text boxes, and drop-down list are two customized buttons and a label aligned horizontally. The two custom buttons are oval-shaped and light gold in color. The first button is labeled Accept in a green font. The second button is labeled Decline in a red font. To the right of the buttons is the label "Not Available".</p>
<p>Below the Accept and Decline buttons and the "Not Available" label are three check boxes aligned horizontally. The boxes are labeled Normal, Checked, and Undefined. The box labeled Checked contains a check mark. The box labeled Undefined contains a dash.</p>
<p>Below the check boxes is a progress bar and a progress indicator. The progress bar is labeled Progress and consists of a narrow bar with a round indicator that is at the left side of the bar.
