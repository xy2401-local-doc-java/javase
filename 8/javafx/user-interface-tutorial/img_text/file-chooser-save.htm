<p>This application shows a screen capture of a Menu Sample. The menu bar is located in the top of the window. It contains the following menus: File, Edit, and View.</p>
<p>The application window renders a picture of hawthorn, the title of the plant (Hawthorn), its binomial name (Crataegus monogyna), and a brief description (The hawthorn is a large genus of shrubs and trees in the rose family, Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America. The name hawthorn was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the Common Hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland).</p>
<p>The context menu overlaps the image. The menu has two items: Copy Image and Save Image. The cursor arrow points to the Save Image context menu, which is highlighted in blue.</p>
