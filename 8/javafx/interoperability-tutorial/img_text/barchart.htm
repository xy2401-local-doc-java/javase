<p>This figure shows an application window that has a table at the bottom part and a bar chart at the top. The title bar of the window displays Swing JTable and Bar Chart. The table has three colums and three rows. The column headings are 2007, 2008, and 2009. The rows are not labeled. The values for 2007 (from top row to bottom row) are 567.0, 1292.0, and 1292.0. The values for 2008 are 956.0, 1665.0, and 2559.0. The values for 2009 are 1154.0, 1927.0, and 2774.0. The bar chart represents the data in the table. The vertical axis of the chart is labeled &rdquo;Units Sold&rdquo; and is marked with tick marks that are labeled in increments of 250. The horizontal axis is labeled &rdquo;Year&rdquo; and subdivided into 2007, 2008, and 2009. A different color bar represents each row: yellow represents the top row, green represents the middle row, and blue represents the bottom row. Each year is displayed as a group of three bars emerging from the horizontal axis.</p>
