<p>This figure shows the hierarchy of event types as a tree structure with the root node at the left and the tree expanding to the right. Each node in the tree is in a blue box. The nodes are connected with gray lines that show the relationship between the nodes. Ellipses are used to indicate that the level has more nodes than are shown.</p>
<p>The root node at the left side of the image is labeled Event.ANY. The Event.ANY node has three branches that are shown to the right and arranged vertically. The first node in the first branch is labeled InputEvent.ANY. This node has three branch nodes that are shown to the right and arranged vertically. The first node in the first branch is labeled KeyEvent.ANY. This node has three leaf nodes that are shown to the right and arranged vertically. These nodes are labeled KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED, KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED, and KeyEvent.KEY_TYPED.</p>
<p>The first node in the second branch for the InputEvent.ANY node is labeled MouseEvent.ANY. This node has three leaf nodes that are shown to the right and arranged vertically. These nodes are labeled MouseEvent.MOUSE_PRESSED, MouseEvent.MOUSE_RELEASED, and an ellipsis that indicates that there are mouse events not shown.</p>
<p>The third branch for the InputEvent.ANY node is an ellipsis that indicates that there are input events not shown.</p>
<p>The second branch for the Event.ANY node contains one leaf node labeled ActionEvent.ACTION.</p>
<p>The first node in the third branch for the Event.ANY node is the WindowEvent.ANY node. This node has three leaf nodes that are shown to the right and arranged vertically. These nodes are labeled WindowEvent.WINDOW_SHOWING, WindowEvent.WINDOW_SHOWN, and an ellipsis that indicates that there are window events not shown.</p>
