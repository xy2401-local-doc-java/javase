<p>This figure shows the hierarchy of nodes for the sample user interface shown in <a href="../processing.htm#CEGFEEEH">Figure 1-2</a> and the event dispatch chain for an event that occurred on the Triangle node. Nodes in the dispatch chain are gray and nodes not in the dispatch chain are blue. At the first level of the hierarchy is the gray Stage node, which is the first node in the dispatch chain. At the second level of the hierarchy and connected to the Stage node is the gray Scene node, which is the second node in the dispatch chain. At the third level of the chain and connected to the Scene node is the gray Group node, which is the third node in the dispatch chain. At the fourth level of the chain and connected to the Group node are the gray Pane and blue Rectangle nodes. The Pane and Rectangle nodes are not connected to each other. The Pane node is the fourth node in the dispatch chain. At the fifth level of the chain and connected to the Pane node are the blue Circle and gray Triangle nodes. The Circle and Triangle nodes are not connected to each other. The Triangle node is the fifth node in the dispatch chain.</p>
