<p>This illustration shows three examples of different blending modes applied to a circle grouped with a square. Both geometrical figures are about the same size, and the center of the circle is located at the left top corner of the square, thus the circle and the square intersect.</p>
<p>The first blending mode is SRC_ATOP. Only a portion of the circle can be seen, but the entire of the square is visible.</p>
<p>The second blending mode is MULTIPLY. Both the circle and the square can be seen. The area where they intersect is transparent.</p>
<p>The third blending mode is SRC_OVER. Both the circle and the square can be seen, but the circle is not transparent, so a portion of the square is covered by the circle.</p>
