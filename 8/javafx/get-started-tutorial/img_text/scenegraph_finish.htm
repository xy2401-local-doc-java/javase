<p>This figure shows that the stage is the top-level container for the ColorfulCircles application, and the scene is the drawing surface for the application's content. A group node named root is the root node for the scene. The root node has one child below it: a group node named <code>blendModeGroup</code>. The blendModeGroup has as children beneath it an (unnamed) group containing a black rectangle and a circles group containing 30 circles. A rectangle named colors is also a child of the blendModeGroup.</p>
