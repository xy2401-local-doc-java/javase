<p>The login form on the left has a white background, stacked black labels, and a right-aligned button with black text on a gray background. The login form on the right has the same content as the login form on the left. However, the look is much improved. The background of the login form is gray with a linen-like texture. The Welcome title is larger, dark gray, and embossed. The User Name and Password labels are also larger and are black with a white drop shadow. The Sign in button has a blue-gray background with bold, white text.</p>
