<h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>To ensure orderly or graceful release of TCP connections is a
challenge with TCP networking applications. Abortive or ungraceful
release may result if special care is not taken. In Java, an
unexpected abortive release can manifest itself by the application
receiving a <code>java.net.SocketException</code> when reading or
writing to the socket. <code>read()</code> and <code>write()</code>
normally return a numeric value indicating, respectively, the
number of bytes received or sent. If an exception is received
instead, this indicates the connection has been aborted and also
that data may have been lost or discarded. This article explains
what causes socket connections to be aborted and provides tips for
avoiding the situation, except for the case where an application
intends to abort the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="description" id="description"></a>Description of the
Problem</h2>
<p>First, we need to distinguish the differences between an
abortive and an orderly connection release. To understand this
distinction we need to look at what happens at the TCP protocol
level. It is helpful to imagine an established TCP connection as
actually two separate, semi-independent streams of data. If the two
peers are A and B, then one stream delivers data from A to B, and
the other stream from B to A. An orderly release occurs in two
stages. First one side (say A) decides to stop sending data and
sends a <code>FIN</code> message across to B. When the TCP stack at
B's side receives the <code>FIN</code> it knows that no more data
is coming from A, and whenever B reads all preceding data off the
socket, further reads will return the value <code>-1</code> to
indicate end-of-file. This procedure is known as the TCP
half-close, because only one half of the connection is closed. Not
surprisingly, the procedure for the other half is exactly the same.
B sends a <code>FIN</code> message to A, who eventually receives a
<code>-1</code> after reading all preceding data sent by A off the
socket.</p>
<p>By contrast, an abortive close uses the RST (Reset) message. If
either side issues an RST, this means the entire connection is
aborted and the TCP stack can throw away any queued data which has
not been sent or received by either application.</p>
<p>So, how do Java applications perform orderly and abortive
releases? Let's consider abortive releases first. A convention that
has existed since the days of the original BSD sockets is that the
&quot;linger&quot; socket option can be used to force an abortive
connection release. Either application can call
<code>Socket.setLinger</code> (true, 0) to tell the TCP stack that
when this socket is closed, the abortive (RST) procedure is to be
used. Setting the linger option has no immediate effect, except
that when <code>Socket.close()</code> is called subsequently, the
connection is aborted with an RST message. As we will see shortly,
there are other ways that may cause a connection to be aborted, but
this is the simplest way to make it happen.</p>
<p>The <code>close()</code> method is also used to perform orderly
release, as well as abortive. So, at its simplest, the difference
between an orderly release and an abortive release could be as
little as not setting the linger(0) option, described above, prior
to calling <code>Socket.close()</code>. Take the example of two
connected peers A and B: If A calls <code>Socket.close()</code>, a
<code>FIN</code> message is sent from A to B; and when B calls
<code>Socket.close()</code>, a <code>FIN</code> is sent from B to
A. In fact, the default setting for the linger option is to not use
abortive close; so if two applications terminate their connection
just by using <code>Socket.close()</code>, then the outcome should
be an orderly release. So what, then, is the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is a slight mismatch between the semantics of
<code>Socket.close()</code> and the TCP <code>FIN</code> message.
Sending a TCP <code>FIN</code> message means &quot;I am finished
sending&quot;, whereas <code>Socket.close()</code> means &quot;I am
finished sending and receiving.&quot; When you call
<code>Socket.close()</code>, clearly it is no longer possible to
send data; nor, however, is it possible to receive data. So what
happens, for example, when A attempts an orderly release by closing
the socket, but B continues to send data? This is perfectly
allowable in the TCP specification, because as far as TCP is
concerned only one half of the connection has been closed. But
since A's socket is closed there is nobody to read data if B should
continue sending. In this situation A's TCP stack must send an RST
to forcibly terminate the connection.</p>
<p>Another common scenario, which may result in an unintended
<code>SocketException</code>, is the following: Say A has sent data
to B, but B closes the socket without reading all the data. In this
situation, B's TCP stack knows that some data is effectively lost
and it will forcibly terminate with RST rather than use the orderly
<code>FIN</code> procedure. A will get a
<code>SocketException</code> if it then tries to send or receive
data from the socket.</p>
<h2><a name="how_to_avoid" id="how_to_avoid"></a>How to avoid the
problem</h2>
<p>There are a number of simple ways to avoid being surprised by
this problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Structure data with a higher-level protocol. Protocols such as
HTTP, which are built on top of TCP, deal with the issue by making
it clear to both sides when it is safe to close the socket.</li>
<li>Always consume data from a socket before closing it. This will
help avoid the second scenario described above.</li>
<li>Use <code>shutdownOutput()</code>. This method has the same
effect as <code>close()</code> in that a <code>FIN</code> is sent
to indicate that this peer has finished sending, but it is still
possible to read from the socket until such time as the remote peer
sends a <code>FIN</code> and end-of-file is read from the stream.
Then the socket can be closed with
<code>Socket.close()</code>.</li>
