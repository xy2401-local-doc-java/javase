<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Preferences API Design FAQ</h1></div>
<h2><a name="prefs-design-faq" id="prefs-design-faq"></a>Design
FAQ</h2>
<p>Following is a collection of frequently asked questions
concerning the design of the Preferences API.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>How does this Preferences API relate to Properties API?</b>
<p>It is intended to replace most common uses of Properties,
rectifying many of its deficiencies, while retaining its light
weight. When using Properties, the programmer must explicitly
specify a pathname for each properties file, but there is no
standard location or naming convention. Properties files are
"brittle", as they are hand-editable but easily corrupted by
careless editing. Support for non-string data types in properties
is non-existent. Properties cannot easily be used with a
persistence mechanism other than the file system. In sum, the
Properties facility does not scale.</p>
</li>
<li><b>How does Preferences API relate to JNDI?</b>
<p>Like JNDI, it provides back-end neutral access to persistent
key-value data. JNDI, however, is far more powerful, and
correspondingly heavyweight. JNDI is appropriate for enterprise
applications that need its power. Preferences API is intended as a
simple, ubiquitous, back-end neutral preferences-management
facility, enabling <b>any</b> Java application to easily tailor its
behavior to user preferences and maintain small amounts of state
from run to run.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why do all of the <code>get</code> methods require the
caller to pass in a default?</b>
<p>This forces the application authors to provide reasonable
default values, so that applications have a reasonable chance of
running even if the repository is unavailable.</p>
</li>
<li><b>How was it decided which methods should throw
<code>BackingStoreException</code>?</b>
<p>Only methods whose semantics absolutely require the ability to
communicate with the backing store throw this exception. Typical
applications will have no need to call these methods. As long as
these methods are avoided, applications will be able to run even if
the backing store is unavailable, which was an explicit design
goal.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API provide stronger guarantees concerning
concurrent access by multiple VMs? Similarly, why doesn't the API
allow multiple Preferences updates to be combined into a single
"transaction", with all or nothing semantics?</b>
<p>While the API does provide rudimentary persistent data storage,
it is not intended as a substitute for a database. It is critical
that it be possible to implement this API atop standard
preference/configuration repositories, most of which do not provide
database-like guarantees and functionality. Such repositories have
proven adequate for the purposes for which this API is
intended.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why does this API have case-sensitive keys and node-names,
while other APIs playing in a similar space (such as the Microsoft
Windows Registry and LDAP) do not?</b>
<p>In the Java programming universe, case-sensitive String keys are
ubiquitous. In particular, they are provided by the Properties
class, which this API is intended to replace. It is not uncommon
for people to use Properties in a fashion that demands
case-sensitivity. For example, Java package names (which are
case-sensitive) are sometimes used as keys. It is recognized that
this design decision complicates the life of the systems programmer
who implements Preferences atop a backing store with
case-insensitive keys, but this is considered an acceptable price
to pay, as far more programmers will use the Preferences API than
will implement it.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API use the Java 2 Collections
Framework?</b>
<p>This API is designed for a very particular purpose, and is
optimized for that purpose. In the absence of generic types (see
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=14">JSR-14</a>), the API
would be less convenient for typical users. It would lack
compile-time type safety, if forced to conform to the <tt>Map</tt>
API. Also, it is not anticipated that interoperability with other
Map implementations will be required (though it would be
straightforward to implement an adapter class if this assumption
turned out to be wrong). Preferences API is, by design, so similar
to Map that programmers familiar with the latter should have no
difficulties using the former.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why don't the put and remove methods return the old
values?</b>
<p>It is desirable that both of these methods be executable even if
the backing store is unavailable. This would not be possible if
they were required to return the old value. Further, it would have
negative performance impact if the API were implemented atop some
common back-end data stores.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why does the API permit, but not require, stored
defaults?</b>
<p>This functionality is required in enterprise settings for
scalable, cost-effective administration of preferences across the
enterprise, but would be overkill in a self-administered
single-user setting.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API contain methods to read and write
arbitrary serializable objects?</b>
<p>Serialized objects are somewhat fragile: if the version of the
program that reads such a property differs from the version that
wrote it, the object may not deserialize properly (or at all). It
is not impossible to store serialized objects using this API, but
we do not encourage it, and have not provided a convenience
method.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Why is <code>Preferences</code> an abstract class rather
than an interface?</b>
<p>It was decided that the ability to add new methods in an upward
compatible fashion outweighed the disadvantage that Preferences
cannot be used as a "mixin" (That is to say, arbitrary classes
cannot also be made to serve as Preferences objects.) Also, this
obviates the need for a separate class for the static methods.
(Interfaces cannot contain static methods.)</p>
</li>
