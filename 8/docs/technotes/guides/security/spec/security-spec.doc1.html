<h2><a name="a21150" id="a21150"><i>1</i> Introduction</a></h2>
<a name="a21151" id="a21151"><!-- --></a> Since the inception of
Java technology, there has been strong and growing interest around
the security of the Java platform as well as new security issues
raised by the deployment of Java technology.
<p><a name="a19099" id="a19099"><!-- --></a> From a technology
provider&#39;s point of view, Java security includes two
aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a19100" id="a19100"><!-- --></a> Provide the Java
platform as a secure, ready-built platform on which to run
Java-enabled applications in a secure fashion.</li>
<li><a name="a19106" id="a19106"><!-- --></a> Provide security
tools and services implemented in the Java programming language
that enable a wider range of security-sensitive applications, for
example, in the enterprise world.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a25283" id="a25283"><!-- --></a> This document discusses
issues related to the first aspect, where the customers for such
technologies include vendors that bundle or embed Java technology
in their products (such as browsers and operating systems).<br />
<h3><a name="a18313" id="a18313"><!-- --></a> <i>1.1</i> The
Original Sandbox Model</h3>
<a name="a18289" id="a18289"><!-- --></a> The original security
model provided by the Java platform is known as the sandbox model,
which existed in order to provide a very restricted environment in
which to run untrusted code obtained from the open network. The
essence of the sandbox model is that local code is trusted to have
full access to vital system resources (such as the file system)
while downloaded remote code (an applet) is not trusted and can
access only the limited resources provided inside the sandbox. This
sandbox model is illustrated in the figure below.
<p><a name="a16452" id="a16452"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="The previous context describes this graphic."
src="security-spec.doc.anc4.gif" />
<p><a name="a16461" id="a16461"><!-- --></a> The sandbox model was
deployed through the Java Development Kit (JDK), and was generally
adopted by applications built with JDK 1.0, including Java-enabled
web browsers.</p>
<p><a name="a16468" id="a16468"><!-- --></a> Overall security is
enforced through a number of mechanisms. First of all, the language
is designed to be type-safe and easy to use. The hope is that the
burden on the programmer is such that the likelihood of making
subtle mistakes is lessened compared with using other programming
languages such as C or C++. Language features such as automatic
memory management, garbage collection, and range checking on
strings and arrays are examples of how the language helps the
programmer to write safe code.</p>
<p><a name="a16496" id="a16496"><!-- --></a> Second, compilers and
a bytecode verifier ensure that only legitimate Java bytecodes are
executed. The bytecode verifier, together with the Java Virtual
Machine, guarantees language safety at run time.</p>
<p><a name="a16541" id="a16541"><!-- --></a> Moreover, a
classloader defines a local name space, which can be used to ensure
that an untrusted applet cannot interfere with the running of other
programs.</p>
<p><a name="a16503" id="a16503"><!-- --></a> Finally, access to
crucial system resources is mediated by the Java Virtual Machine
and is checked in advance by a SecurityManager class that restricts
the actions of a piece of untrusted code to the bare minimum.</p>
<p><a name="a18306" id="a18306"><!-- --></a> JDK 1.1 introduced the
concept of a &#34;signed applet&#34;, as illustrated by the figure
below. In that release, a correctly digitally signed applet is
treated as if it is trusted local code if the signature key is
recognized as trusted by the end system that receives the applet.
Signed applets, together with their signatures, are delivered in
the JAR (Java Archive) format. In JDK 1.1, unsigned applets still
run in the sandbox.</p>
<p><a name="a22321" id="a22321"><!-- --></a></p>

"security-spec.doc.anc3.gif" />
<br />
<h3><a name="a18314" id="a18314"><!-- --></a> <i>1.2</i> Evolving
the Sandbox Model</h3>
<a name="a18301" id="a18301"><!-- --></a> The new Java SE Platform
Security Architecture, illustrated in the figure below, is
introduced primarily for the following purposes.
<p><a name="a22333" id="a22333"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="See long description" longdesc=
"security-spec.txt" src="security-spec.doc.anc9.gif" />
<a href="security-spec.txt" title="Long description for">[D]</a>
<p><a name="a22325" id="a22325"><!-- --></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a16298" id="a16298"><!-- --></a> Fine-grained access
control.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a16300" id="a16300"><!-- --></a> This capability existed
in the JDK from the beginning, but to use it, the application
writer had to do substantial programming (e.g., by subclassing and
customizing the SecurityManager and ClassLoader classes). The
HotJava browser 1.0 is such an application, as it allows the
browser user to choose from a small number of different security
levels.
<p><a name="a22625" id="a22625"><!-- --></a> However, such
programming is extremely security-sensitive and requires
sophisticated skills and in-depth knowledge of computer security.
The new architecture will make this exercise simpler and safer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="a16304" id="a16304"><!-- --></a> Easily configurable
security policy.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a16306" id="a16306"><!-- --></a> Once again, this
capability existed previously in the JDK but was not easy to use.
Moreover, writing security code is not straightforward, so it is
desirable to allow application builders and users to configure
security policies without having to program.
<ul>
<li><a name="a16310" id="a16310"><!-- --></a> Easily extensible
access control structure.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a29339" id="a29339"><!-- --></a> Up to JDK 1.1, in order
to create a new access permission, you had to add a new
<code>check</code> method to the SecurityManager class. The new
architecture allows typed permissions (each representing an access
to a system resource) and automatic handling of all permissions
(including yet-to-be-defined permissions) of the correct type. No
new method in the SecurityManager class needs to be created in most
cases. (In fact, we have so far not encountered a situation where a
new method must be created.)
<ul>
<li><a name="a16316" id="a16316"><!-- --></a> Extension of security
checks to all Java programs, including applications as well as
applets.</li>
</ul>
<a name="a16318" id="a16318"><!-- --></a> There is no longer a
built-in concept that all local code is trusted. Instead, local
code (e.g., non-system code, application packages installed on the
local file system) is subjected to the same security control as
applets, although it is possible, if desired, to declare that the
policy on local code (or remote code) be the most liberal, thus
enabling such code to effectively run as totally trusted. The same
principle applies to signed applets and any Java application.
<p><a name="a19718" id="a19718"><!-- --></a> Finally, an implicit
goal is to make internal adjustment to the design of security
classes (including the SecurityManager and ClassLoader classes) to
reduce the risks of creating subtle security holes in future
programming.</p>
