<div>
<div><span>This chapter identifies performance issues with a Java application and debugs these issues using the Java Flight Recorder.</span></div>
<p>The Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a commercial feature. You can use it for free on developer desktops or laptops, and for evaluation purposes in test, development, and production environments. However, to enable JFR <span class="bold">on a production server, you must have a commercial license</span>. Using the JMC UI for other purposes on the JDK <span class="bold">does not require a commercial license</span>.</p>
<p>To know more about the JFR commercial license, see the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html" target="_blank">license agreement</a>. To know more about creating a flight recording, see <a href="diagnostic-tools.htm#GUID-14DD9297-94CE-4B03-B6B9-4D5B6A7774DC" title="Use Java Mission Control (JMC) to easily manage flight recordings.Use startup flags at the command line to produce profiling recording, continuous recording, and using diagnostic commands.You can set up Java Mission Control to automatically start or dump a flight recording if a condition is met. This is done from the JMX console. To start the JMX console, find your application in the JVM Browser, right-click it, and select Start JMX Browser.">How to Produce a Flight Recording</a>.</p>
<p>The Java Flight Recorder is a great tool to investigate performance issues. No other tool gives as much profiling data without skewing the results with its own performance overhead. This chapter gives examples of performance issues that you can identify and debug issues using the Java Flight Recorder.</p>

<div>
<p>When you measure performance, it is important to consider any performance overhead added by the flight recorder itself. The overhead differs depending on the application. In case you have any performance tests set up, you can measure if there is any noticeable overhead on your specific application.</p>
<p>That said, the overhead for recording a standard profiling recording using the default settings is less than 2 percent for most applications. Running with a standard continuous recording generally has no measurable performance effect.</p>
<p>One major contributor to the overhead is the Heap Statistics events, which is disabled by default. Enabling Heap Statistics triggers an old garbage collection at the beginning and the at end of the test run. These old GCs give some extra pause times to the application, so if you are measuring latency or if your environment is sensitive to pause times, don't run with Heap Statistics enabled. Heap Statistics are great when debugging memory leaks or when investigating the live set of the application. See <a href="troubleshoot-memory-leaks.htm#GUID-FA5677A5-B175-40B4-B7F0-851118B6B7AD" title="The Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a commercial feature.

<div>
<p>Different applications have different bottlenecks. For some applications, a bottleneck may be waiting for I/O or networking, it may be synchronization between threads, or it may be actual CPU usage. For others, a bottleneck may be garbage collection times. It is possible that an application has more than one bottleneck.</p>
<div class="section">
<p>One way to find out the application bottlenecks is to look at the <span class="bold">Events</span> tab. This is an advanced tab, and there are a few things to do. First, click the <span class="bold">Events</span> tab, which opens the <span class="bold">Event Types</span> tab on the left side of the JFR window. This is where you select the events that you are interested in looking at. For now, select all Java Application events except for <span class="bold">Statistics</span> and <span class="bold">Allocation,</span> as shown in <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-82335401-BDC8-47E5-871A-174B8B3AAD8C__CJADBFCH">Figure 4-1</a>.</p>

<a href="img_text/jfr-eventtypes.htm">Description of "Figure 4-1 Find Bottlenecks - Java Application Events"</a></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>Now, in all the <span class="bold">Events</span> tabs, you will only see these events. Next, from the <span class="bold">Graph</span> tab, look at the main threads for the Java application, as shown in <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-82335401-BDC8-47E5-871A-174B8B3AAD8C__CJAIFEEG">Figure 4-2</a>.</p>

<a href="img_text/jfr-eventgraph.htm">Description of "Figure 4-2 Find Bottlenecks - Main Threads from the Graph Tab"</a></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>The <span class="bold">Graph</span> tab may be hard to grasp at first. Each row is a thread, and each thread can have several lines. In <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-82335401-BDC8-47E5-871A-174B8B3AAD8C__CJAIFEEG">Figure 4-2</a>, each thread has a line, which represents the Java Application events that were enabled in the <span class="bold">Event Types</span> tab for this recording. The selected Java Application events all have the important property that they are all thread-stalling events. Thread stalling indicates that the thread was not running your application during the event, and they are all duration events. The duration event measures the duration the application was not running.</p>
<p>From the <span class="bold">Event Types</span> tab, look at the color of each event. For example, <span class="italic">yellow</span> represents <span class="bold">Java Monitor Wait</span> events. The yellow part is when threads are waiting for an object. This often means that the thread is idle, perhaps waiting for a task. <span class="italic">Red</span> represents the <span class="bold">Java Monitor Blocked</span> events or synchronization events. If your Java application's important threads spend a lot of time being blocked, then that means that a critical section of the application is single threaded, which is a bottleneck. <span class="italic">Blue</span> represents the <span class="bold">Socket Reads</span> and <span class="bold">Socket Writes</span> events. Again, if the Java application spends a lot of time waiting for sockets, then the main bottleneck may be in the network or with the other machines that the application communicates.</p>
<p>From <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-82335401-BDC8-47E5-871A-174B8B3AAD8C__CJAIFEEG">Figure 4-2</a>, <span class="italic">green</span> represents parts that don't have any events. The <span class="italic">green</span> part means that the thread is not sleeping, waiting, reading to or from a socket, or not being blocked. In general, this is where the application code is run. If your Java application's important threads are spending a lot of time without generating any application events, then the bottleneck in the application is the time spent executing code or the CPU itself.</p>
<div class="p">
<div class="infobox-note" id="GUID-82335401-BDC8-47E5-871A-174B8B3AAD8C__GUID-CD91FD0D-4BCB-4B00-A3C9-1ABC7E920C85">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
For most Java Application event types, only events longer than 20 ms are recorded. (This threshold can be modified when starting the flight recording.) To summarize, the areas may not have recorded events because the application is doing a lot of short tasks, such as writing to a file (a small part at a time) or spending time in synchronization for very short amounts of time.</div>
</div>
<p>Each of the previous bottlenecks can be further investigated within the flight recording.</p>
<p>The <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Event</span></span> tab does not show garbage collections and whether garbage collections may be a bottleneck. See the next topic about garbage collection performance.</p>

<div>
<p>Java application issues with garbage collections can be diagnosed using JFR.</p>
<div class="section">
<p>Tuning the HotSpot Garbage Collector can have a big effect on performance. See <a class="olink JSGCT-GUID-326EB4CF-8C8C-4267-8355-21AB04F0D304" target="_blank" href="../gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.htm#JSGCT-GUID-326EB4CF-8C8C-4267-8355-21AB04F0D304">Garbage Collection Tuning Guide</a>for general information.</p>
<p>First, take a profiling flight recording of your application when it is up and running. Do not include the heap statistics, because that will trigger extra old collections. To get a good sample, take a longer recording, for example 1 hour.</p>
<p>Select the <span class="bold">Memory</span> tab, and then select the <span class="bold">GC Times</span> subtab. <span class="italic"><span class="bold">GC Times</span></span> is a good tab to investigate the overall performance impact of the GC. From the top-right corner, see the <span class="bold">All Collections Pause Time</span> section, and look at the <span class="italic">Average Sum of Pauses</span>, <span class="italic">Maximum Sum of Pauses</span>, and <span class="italic">Total Pause Time</span> from the recording. The <span class="italic">Sum of Pauses</span> is the total amount of time that the application was paused during a GC. Many GCs do most of their work in the background. In those cases, the length of the GC does not matter and what matters is how long the application actually had to stop. Therefore, the <span class="italic">Sum of Pauses</span> is a good measure for the GC effect.</p>
<p><a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-E9C795D6-3D7A-4CD8-84DD-4F7DE3200614__CJAFGGAC">Figure 4-3</a> shows a flight recording for 5 minutes (as seen from the time select bar). During this time, the <span class="italic">average sum of pauses</span> was 16 ms, the <span class="italic">maximum sum of pauses</span> was 49 ms, and the <span class="italic">total pause time</span> was 2s 86 ms.</p>

<a href="img_text/jfr-gctime.htm">Description of "Figure 4-3 Garbage Collection Performance - GC Pauses"</a></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>The main performance problems with garbage collections are usually either that individual GCs take too long, or that too much time is spent in paused GCs (total GC pauses).</p>
<p>When an individual GC takes too long, you may need to change the GC strategy. Different GCs have different trade-offs when it comes to pause times verses throughput performance. See <a class="olink JSGCT-GUID-3D0BB91E-9BFF-4EBB-B523-14493A860E73" target="_blank" href="../gctuning/ergonomics.htm#JSGCT-GUID-3D0BB91E-9BFF-4EBB-B523-14493A860E73">Behavior-Based Tuning.</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you may also need to fix your application so that it makes less use of finalizers or semireferences.</p>
<p>When the application spends too much time paused, there are different ways to work around that.</p>
<p>One way is to increase the Java heap size. Look at the <span class="bold">Garbage Collection</span> subtab to estimate the heap size used by the application, and change <span class="italic">Xms</span> and <span class="italic">Xmx</span> to a higher value. The bigger the Java heap, the longer time it is between GCs. Watch out for any memory leaks in the Java application, because that may cause more and more frequent GCs until an <code class="codeph">OutOfMemoryError</code> is thrown. For more information, see <a href="troubleshoot-memory-leaks.htm#GUID-FA5677A5-B175-40B4-B7F0-851118B6B7AD" title="The Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a commercial feature. You can use it for free on developer desktops or laptops, and for evaluation purposes in test, development, and production environments.">Debug a Memory Leak Using Java Flight Recorder</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce the number for GCs is to allocate fewer temporary objects. Under the <span class="bold">Allocations</span> tab, look at how much memory is allocated over the course of the recording. Small objects are allocated inside <span class="bold">TLABs</span>, and large objects are allocated outside <span class="bold">TLABs</span>. Often, the majority of allocations happen inside <span class="bold">TLABs</span>.</p>
<p>Last, to reduce the need of GCs, decrease the allocation rate. Select the <span class="bold">Allocation in new TLAB</span> tab and then choose <span class="bold">Allocations</span> tab to look at the allocation sites and stack traces that have the most memory pressure. You can either view it per class, or select the <span class="bold">Allocation by Thread</span> to see which threads consume the most allocation.</p>
<p>For general details about the JFR <span class="bold">Allocation</span> tab, see <a href="diagnostic-tools.htm#GUID-7E8058D0-249E-44DB-8714-3AA9DA6A4DB8" title="Information about how to get a sample JFR to inspect a flight recording and various tabs in Java Mission Control for you to analyze the flight recordings.">Inspect a Flight Recording</a>.</p>
<p>Some other settings may also increase GC performance of the Java application. See <a class="olink JSGCT-GUID-ED3AB6D3-FD9B-4447-9EDF-983ED2F7A573" target="_blank" href="../gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector.htm#JSGCT-GUID-ED3AB6D3-FD9B-4447-9EDF-983ED2F7A573">Garbage Collection Tuning Guide</a> in the <span><cite>Java Platform, Standard Edition HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide</cite></span> to discuss GC performance.</p>

<div>
<p>To debug Java Application synchronization issues, or in other words where the application threads spend a lot of time waiting to enter a monitor, look at the <span class="bold">Contention</span> tab in the <span class="bold">Threads</span> tab group.</p>
<div class="section">

<p>Typically, look for contention that you did not think would be an issue. Logging is a common area that can be an unexpected bottleneck in some applications.</p>
<p>When you see performance degradation after a program update or at any specific times in the Java application, take a flight recording when things are good, and take another one when things are bad to look for a synchronization site that increases a lot.</p>

<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The events shown in the range selector are not all synchronization events. By default, contention events with a duration longer than 20 ms are recorded. (This threshold can be modified when starting the flight recording.) Shorter thresholds give more events and also potentially <span class="italic">more overhead</span>. If you believe contention is an issue, then you could take a shorter recording with a very low threshold (only a few milliseconds). When this is done on a live application, make sure to start with a very short recording, and monitor the performance overhead.</div>

<div>
<p>You can diagnose I/O issues in an application by monitoring the <span class="bold">Socket Read</span> tab under the <span class="bold">I/O</span> group.</p>
<div class="section">
<p>When a Java application spends a lot of time either in <span class="bold">Socket Read</span>, <span class="bold">Socket Write</span>, <span class="bold">File Read</span>, or <span class="bold">File Write</span>, then I/O or networking may be the bottleneck. To diagnose I/O issues in applications, look at the <span class="bold">Socket Read</span> tab under the <span class="bold">I/O</span> group, as shown in <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-AB398CCB-03A1-48E4-B573-2363DFB6ACA3__CJAICDEE">Figure 4-5</a>.</p>

<p><a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-AB398CCB-03A1-48E4-B573-2363DFB6ACA3__CJAICDEE">Figure 4-5</a> shows that the application had 100 reads from the remote address 198.51.100.0. The total number of bytes read is 356 bytes, and the total time spent waiting is 1 min 57 s. Select the <span class="bold">By Event</span> tab at the top-left corner, and look at each event to analyze the time spent and data read.</p>
<p>File or networking I/O issues are diagnosed in a similar fashion. Look at the files read to or written to the most, then see each file read/write and the time spent on I/O.</p>
<p>All the tabs in I/O, by default list events with a duration longer than 20 ms. When starting a flight recording, you can lower the <span class="italic">File I/O Threshold</span> or the <span class="italic">Socket I/O Threshold</span> to gather more data, potentially with a higher performance effect.</p>

<div>
<p>The code execution performance can be monitored using the Java Mission Control, <span class="bold">Call Tree</span> tab.</p>
<div class="section">
<p>When there are not a lot of Java Application events, it could be that the main bottleneck of your application is the running code. First, look at the <span class="bold">Threads</span> tab, and select the <span class="bold">Overview</span> tab. See <span class="italic">CPU Usage Over Time</span>. This shows the CPU usage of the JVM being recorded and the total CPU usage on the machine. In case the JVM CPU usage is low, but the CPU usage of the machine is high, which means some other application is taking a lot of CPU. Then, look at the other applications running on the system in the <span class="bold">Processes</span> tab from the <span class="bold">System</span> tab group. However, you may not see their CPU usage, so it is usually easier to use OS tools such as <span class="bold">Top</span> or the task manager to find out which processes are using a lot of CPU.</p>
<p>Select the <span class="bold">Code</span> tab group and look at the <span class="bold">Hot Threads</span> tab in case your application is using a lot of CPU time. This tab shows the threads that use the most CPU time. However, this information is based on <span class="italic">method sampling</span>, so it may not be 100% accurate if the sample count is low. When a JFR is running, the JVM samples the threads. By default, a continuous recording does only some <span class="italic">method sampling</span>, while a profiling recording does as much as possible. The <span class="italic">method sampling</span> gathers data from only those threads running code. The threads waiting for I/O, sleeping, waiting for locks, and so on are not sampled. Therefore, threads with a lot of method samples are the ones using the most CPU time; however, how much CPU is used by each thread is not known.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">Hot Methods</span> tab in the <span class="bold">Code</span> tab group helps find out where your application spends most of the execution time. This tab shows all the samples grouped by top method in the stack. Use the <span class="bold">Call Tree</span> tab to start with the lowest method in the stack traces and then move upward. <a href="troubleshoot-performance-issues-using-jfr.htm#GUID-82079DCD-8CAC-428A-9D61-B10B4305B476__CJAFHAIH">Figure 4-6</a> starts with <code class="codeph">Thread.run</code>, and then looks at the calls that have been most sampled.</p>
