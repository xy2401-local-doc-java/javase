<strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 
You should be familiar with the event model used by the JNDI
before reading this section.
The event model is covered in the

A service provider typically supports event notification only
when the underlying naming/directory service provides such a feature.
However, a service provider may support event notification
even if the underlying service does not. It simply needs
to do more work and perhaps offer the feature by polling
the underlying service for changes.
<p>
<h4>Architectural Overview</h4>
Event notification can be implemented in several different
ways. Following is one sample architecture. However,
the one that works 
for your service provider will depend on the features
of the underlying naming/directory service.
<p>
To add event notification support, you need the following
three components.
<ul>
<li><b>Bookkeeper.</b>  Maintains the list of 
listeners and is responsible for implementing the
registration/deregistration methods in the
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventContext.html"><tt>EventContext</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventContext.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>    and
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventDirContext.html"><tt>EventDirContext</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/event/EventDirContext.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>    interfaces.

<li><b>Notifier.</b> Notifies
the listener(s) of an event. The occurrence of an event is typically
triggered by an asynchronous change in the underlying service. 
The notifier detects the change
(for example, via a message from the underlying service or by
polling the state of the underlying service) and 
puts a corresponding event in the event queue.

<li><b>Event Queue.</b> Maintains
a queue of events that have occurred and 
fires the events to the registered listeners.
</ul>

To implement event notification, your context implementation must
implement either the <tt>EventContext</tt> or <tt>EventDirContext</tt>
interface. The bookkeeper might be a part of the context
implementation or a utility used by the context
implementation.  When a program registers a listener, the bookkeeper
records the listener and the target in which it is interested.
It then uses--creates or uses one from a thread pool--a 
notifier to track the target. Typically, the notifier is a thread
that listens for changes to the target.  When the notifier detects a
change that will trigger an event, it creates an event that contains the
appropriate information and puts it in the event queue. The notifier
then returns to listening for future changes.  The event queue is
monitored by an event queue manager thread, whose job is to remove an
event from the queue and dispatch it to the appropriate listeners.

<h4>Implementation Tips</h4>

Here are some tips to keep in mind when developing your
context implementation.

<ul>
<li>Handling listener registration.
<br>Listener registration is associated
with a <tt>Context</tt> <em>instance</em>
and not the representation of the
context in the underlying service. For example, suppose that you are
using the LDAP service.
You cannot expect to register a listener with one 
<tt>Context</tt> instance
and remove it from another <tt>Context</tt> instance,
even if both represent the same LDAP entry.
Therefore your implementation should maintain separate listener lists for
separate <tt>Context</tt> instances.

<li>When to deregister.
<br>
Some events cause automatic deregistration. If a listener receives
an exception or if the <tt>Context</tt> instance with 
which it has registered
is closed, then the listener is automatically deregistered
and  will receive
no further events. Your notifier implementation should pay attention
to the exception events that it generates and tell the bookkeeper
to deregister listeners that receive such events
(but only <em>after</em> the exception events have been delivered).

<li>Using threads.
<br>
Regardless of
whether you choose to follow the sample
architecture described previously in this section, 
support for event notification
requires the use of threads. Furthermore, these threads manipulate
shared data such as <tt>Context</tt> instances, event queues, and listener
lists.  Be sure to have a good understanding of the threads model in
the Java programming language. 

</ul>
