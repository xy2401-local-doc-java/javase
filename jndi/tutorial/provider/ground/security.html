<h2>
    Security Considerations
</h2>
<p>

Security considerations from the API user's perspective
are discussed in the

<a target="_top" href="../../beyond/misc/security.html">Miscellaneous</a> <a target="_top" href="../../beyond/misc/security.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>    lesson.

As a service provider developer, you should be aware of the following
additional considerations.

<h4>Privileged Code</h4>

The 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2>Java 2 Platform, 
Standard Edition</a>, defines a
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security>security
model</a>
for system administrators and users to use to dynamically configure the security policy
for running applications.
You should be familiar with that security model before writing
any service provider code. 
This discussion covers some issues pertinent
to service provider code but is not a substitute for your reading
and thoroughly understanding the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security>Java Security Guide</a>.

<p>
The security model allows you to mark sections of your code as
<em>privileged</em> by wrapping each section inside of a
<tt>doPrivileged</tt> block.  The system administrator or user can then grant
permissions to your code separate from those that it grants to other
components of the application.  Because service provider code is often
considered "system" code and is granted all permissions by system
administrators and users, you must be careful which permissions
that the service
provider requests.  Or more precisely, you must be careful which
sections of code that you put inside of <tt>doPrivileged</tt> blocks.
Otherwise, you might be introducing security holes that can be
exploited by malicious applications.
<p>
In general, a <tt>doPrivileged</tt> block should not be publicly accessible.
Rather, it should be accessible in the smallest scope possible, with the
package-private scope being the widest recommended scope.
The code inside of a
<tt>doPrivileged</tt> block should perform the narrowest functionality
required. 
<p>
For example, you should never have a <tt>doPrivileged</tt>
block for reading arbitrary system properties,
accessing local files, or creating network connections.
On the other hand, it might be reasonable to have a <tt>doPrivileged</tt>
block for reading a specific system property, reading a specific
configuration file, or creating
a network connection to the local machine on a specific port number.
<p>
In general, keep the number of <tt>doPrivileged</tt> blocks to a minimum.
Always ask yourself if it is reasonable for the administrator or user to know
that an application requires such a permission
(and therefore afforded the opportunity to deny the request) 
or is the action harmless enough
that the provider should request the permission for the action on behalf of the application.
<p>
See the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/security>Java Security 
Guide</a>
for a general discussion of the Java security model and <tt>doPrivileged</tt>
blocks.


<h4>Environment Properties</h4>

The

<a target="_top" href="../../beyond/misc/security.html">Miscellaneous</a> <a target="_top" href="../../beyond/misc/security.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>    lesson talks about security considerations associated
with environment properties.
The <a href=env.html>Environment Properties</a> section of this lesson
describes how a provider should handle environment properties.
The main security-related issue to note from these discussions is
that, as a service provider writer, you should never return a context's
copy of its environment properties. Rather, you should always return a clone
or copy. This will forestall any possible tampering or accidental
corruption of one of a <tt>Context</tt> instance's most important state--its
environment properties.
<p>
If your context implementation is serializable, then you should
avoid serializing any passwords or other security-sensitive
environment properties.


<h4>Network Security</h4>

Most naming and directory services are accessed over the
network. Although the data requested is protected by the server's
authentication and access control mechanisms, some protocols do not
protect (encrypt) the data that is sent as replies. This is not a
problem particular to a client using the JNDI but
rather a problem for any client accessing that service.
Your service provider's documentation should describe the
security implications associated with accessing its corresponding
service over a network.
