<h2>
    Creating a Federation
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

You create a federation in either of two ways:
<ul>
<li>
By explicit administration
<li>
By dynamic composition
</ul>
<p>
In the former way, you explicitly bind the reference of one naming system 
into a context in another naming system. For example, you might 
record reference information
about the local departmental LDAP naming system into a DNS system such that
applications can subsequently resolve a composite name that contains 
the DNS name and the LDAP name.
In the latter way, you have the federation
be created dynamically 
as the resolution of a composite name proceeds.
For example, a file system contains different types of files.
Some of those files might be ZIP formatted. 
You can create a federation by using a composite name
that contains the filename and its entry within the ZIP file.
In this way, the federation is created dynamically with no
external assistance and can be as varied as the types of
files and their corresponding service providers.
<p>

An explicit binding consists of a name and a reference.  Depending on the
naming system in which the reference is bound, the actual reference
might take different forms.  For example, a departmental LDAP naming
system might be <em>bound</em> into the DNS via a DNS SRV record
that contains the LDAP servers' IP addresses and DNs.  
Or, the JNDI reference of an application naming system
might be bound in an LDAP naming system.
Also, a naming system might be represented differently in different
superior naming systems. For example, the same
naming system might be bound by using different data in the DNS and in the LDAP.
Regardless of its storage format, a reference is eventually
represented programmatically by a
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html"><tt>Reference</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>.
The
<a target="_top" href="../../objects/index.html">Java Objects and the Directory</a> <a href="../../objects/index.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/objectsIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Java Objects and the Directory trail)"></a>    lesson describes how a <tt>Reference</tt> can be transformed
to and from its actual representation.
<p>
From a service provider developer's perspective,
it is a good idea to 
define a reference for the context implementation.
This encourages users of the provider to use a consistent
reference when referring to contexts in the implementation and when
binding contexts from the implementation
into foreign naming systems.

<h4>Reference</h4>

A context's reference should contain the data required to create
a <tt>Context</tt> instance.  
If the context represents state on a naming
or directory server, then its reference should at a minimum contain
information on how to contact the server and how to identify its state
within the server. Sometimes this task is complicated by the fact
that access to the server might be controlled and require authentication.
You are advised not to place security-sensitive information
such as passwords in a reference. 
Rather, the reference should be generic and
the context's authentication information ignored.
<p>

If the service provider already has a URL context implementation and
a factory for the context implementation, then you can leverage that when
designing the context's reference. For example, you can simply make the
reference contain the URL(s) of the context.  
This not only makes
access to the context more consistent, but also significantly
simplifies the
implementation of the corresponding object factory.

<h4>Object Factory</h4>

Once you have defined the format of the reference for your context
implementation, you can write an object factory for it.  
Thus applications will be able
to access your context implementation via references
instead of names.
<p>
Following is an example of an object factory written to use
the URL context factory of the same context implementation.
For example, suppose that your context implementation supports
the <tt>foo</tt> URL scheme and has the URL context factory
<tt>tut.foo.fooURLContextFactory</tt>.
The corresponding object factory
<a href=src/tut/FooCtxFactory.java><tt>FooCtxFactory</tt></a>
might look as follows.
<blockquote><pre>
public class FooCtxFactory implements ObjectFactory {
    public FooCtxFactory() {
    }

    public Object getObjectInstance(Object ref, Name name, Context nameCtx,
	Hashtable env) throws Exception {

	if ((ref instanceof Reference) &amp;&amp;
	    myClassName.equals(((Reference)ref).getFactoryClassName())) {
	    
	    // Create a URL context factory
	    ObjectFactory factory = new tut.foo.fooURLContextFactory();

	    // Extract the URL(s) from the Reference
	    String[] urls = getURLs((Reference)ref);

	    // Ask the URL context factory to process the URL(s)
	    return factory.getObjectInstance(urls, name, nameCtx, env);
	}

	// This is not meant for this factory
	return null;
    }
}
</blockquote></pre>
<tt>getURLs()</tt> is a utility that extracts the URL strings from the 
reference's addresses.

<h4>Referenceable</h4>

A symmetric relationship is not needed for binding the context.
Simply because you can look up a context from a foreign naming
system does not necessarily mean that you can programmatically bind
(the reference of) the same context into that foreign naming system.
The binding could have been added administratively through
tools specific for that foreign naming server.
<p>
Nevertheless, you can plan for programmatic binding support
by making your context implementation <em>referenceable</em>.
To do this, make the implementation implement the
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Referenceable.html"><tt>Referenceable</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Referenceable.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>    interface. Also, provide an implementation for
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Referenceable.html#getReference()"><tt>getReference()</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Referenceable.html#getReference()"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>.
This method should return a reference that can be fed back into
the provider's object factory.
