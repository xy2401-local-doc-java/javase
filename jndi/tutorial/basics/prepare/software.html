<h2>
    Required Software
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Following is a list of the software/systems that you need:

<ul>
<li><a href=#JDK>Java platform software</a>
<li><a href=#JNDI>JNDI software</a>
<li><a href=#PROVIDER>Service provider software</a>
<li><a href=#SERVER>Naming and directory server software</a>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4><a name=JDK>Java Platform Software</a></h4>

To run applications or applets that use the
JNDI, you need a v1.1.2 or higher of the Java platform
software (such as 
the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">Java 2 Software Development Kit (SDK)</a> software).
<p>
To run the applets, you can use any Java-compatible Web browser,
such as
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/HotJava">HotJava browser</a>,
<a href="http://www.netscape.com/download/">Netscape Communicator 
or Navigator v4</a>, or
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet Explorer v5</a>.
To ensure that your applets take full advantage of the latest
features of the Java platform software, you can use the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">Java Plug-in</a>
with your Web browser.

<h4><a name=JNDI>JNDI Software</a></h4>

The JNDI class libraries are already included with the
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>.
If you are using another version of the SDK,
then you can use the JNDI software available from the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jndi">JNDI Web site</a>.
All sample code from this tutorial, as well as the tutorial
itself, can also be downloaded from that site.

<h4><a name=PROVIDER>Service Provider Software</a></h4>

The JNDI API is a generic API for accessing any naming or directory
service.
Actual access to a naming or directory service is enabled by plugging in a 
service provider under the JNDI.
An overview of the JNDI architecture and the role of
service providers is given in the

<a target="_top" href="../../getStarted/overview/index.html">JNDI Overview</a> <a target="_top" href="../../getStarted/overview/index.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/getStartedIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Getting Started trail)"></a>     lesson.

<p>
A <em>service provider</em> is software that maps the JNDI API
to actual calls to the naming or directory server.
Typically, the roles
of the service provider and that of the naming/directory server
differ.
In the terminology of client/server software, the JNDI and the service provider 
are the <em>client</em>
(called the <em>JNDI client</em>) and
the naming/directory server is the <em>server</em>.
<p>
Clients and servers may interact in many ways.
In one common way, they use a network protocol so that the
client and server can exist autonomously in a networked environment.
The server typically supports many different clients, 
not only JNDI clients, provided that the clients conform to the
specified protocol.
The JNDI does not dictate any particular style of interaction between
JNDI clients and servers. For example,
at one extreme the client and server could be
the same entity.
<p>
You need to obtain the classes for the service providers that you will
be using.
For example, if you plan to use the JNDI to access
an LDAP directory server, then you would need software for
an LDAP service provider.
<p>
The
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>
comes with service providers for LDAP, COS naming, and the RMI registry.
If you are using an earlier version of the SDK, 
then you need to get the service providers.
The <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/serviceproviders.html>JNDI Web site</a> lists
service providers you can download, including one for the LDAP.
<p>
This tutorial uses two service providers: 
<ul>
<li>
The file system service provider for the naming examples
<li>
The LDAP service provider for the directory and event notification examples
</ul>
The file system service provider can be obtained from the
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/serviceproviders.html>JNDI Web site</a>.
<p>
When using the file system service provider,
you don't need to set up a server because you can use your
local file system as the server.
When using the LDAP service provider, you need either to
set up your own server or to have access to an
existing server, as explained next.

<h4><a name=SERVER>Naming and Directory Server Software</a></h4>

Once you have obtained the service provider software, you
then need to set up or have 
access to a corresponding naming/directory server.
Setting up a naming/directory server is typically the job of a network
system administrator.
Different vendors have different installation procedures for
their naming/directory servers.
Some require special machine privileges before the server can be installed.
You should consult the naming/directory server software's installation
instructions.
<p>
For the naming examples in this tutorial, you'll use the file system.
<p>
For the directory examples in this tutorial, you need
access to an LDAP server.
You can use any LDAP-compliant server.
The Sun ONE Directory Server, which runs on many platforms, including Windows,
is available for evaluation at:
<a href=http://wwws.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr/home_directory.html>http://wwws.sun.com/software/products/directory_srvr/home_directory.html</a>.
You can also download a free LDAP server from
<a href=http://www.OpenLDAP.org/>OpenLDAP</a>.
See <a href=content.html>the next part of this lesson</a>
for information on populating the LDAP server with content for running
this tutorial's examples.
<p>

Publicly accessible servers are also available at 
the following URLs:
<ul>
<tt>
<li>ldap://ldap.Bigfoot.com
<li>ldap://ldap.four11.com
<li>ldap://ldap.InfoSpace.com
</tt>
</ul>
