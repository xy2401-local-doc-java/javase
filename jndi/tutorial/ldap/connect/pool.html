    Connection Pooling

The <a href=create.html>Connection Creation</a> section described when
connections are created. It described how several <tt>Context</tt>
instances can share the same connection.  In this type of sharing,
operations from the different <tt>Context</tt> instances are
multiplexed onto the same connection.  You can control the degree of
sharing by deciding when to create a new initial context and when to
obtain a derived <tt>Context</tt> instance from an existing
<tt>Context</tt> instance.  This type of connection sharing satisfies
most applications.

<P> 

Another type of connection sharing supported by the LDAP service
provider is called <em>connection pooling</em>.  In this type of
sharing, the LDAP service provider maintains a pool of (possibly)
previously used connections and assigns them to a <tt>Context</tt>
instance as needed.  When a <tt>Context</tt>
instance is done with a connection (closed or garbage collected), the
connection is returned to the pool for future use. 
Note that this form of sharing is sequential: a connection is retrieved
from the pool, used, returned to the pool, and then, retrieved again
from the pool for another <tt>Context</tt> instance. 
<p>

The pool of connections is maintained per Java runtime system.  As
such, it can be used by all of the ways in which a connection can be
created, as described in the <a href=create.html>Connection
Creation</a> section.  For example, a connection required for
processing a referral can use a pooled connection, as can a connection
required for constructing an <tt>InitialContext</tt>. For some
situations, this can improve performance significantly. For example,
only one connection is required for processing a search response that
contains four referral references to the same LDAP server if
connection pooling is used.  Without connection pooling, such a
scenario would require four separate connections.

<p>
A pooled connection can be shared by multiple <tt>Context</tt> instances,
using the same model described in the 
<a href=create.html#SHARE>Connection Creation</a> section. 
The only difference
is that the underlying connection might have come from a pool instead
of being created fresh.
<p>
The rest of this lesson describes in more detail how to use connection pooling.


<h4>How to Use Connection Pooling</h4>

You request connection pooling by adding the property,
<tt>"com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool"</tt> to the environment properties
passed to the initial context constructor.  

Here is <a href=src/UsePool.java>an example</a>.
<blockquote>
<pre>
// Set up environment for creating initial context
Hashtable env = new Hashtable(11);
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, 
    "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ldap://localhost:389/o=JNDITutorial");

// Enable connection pooling
env.put("com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool", "true");

// Create one initial context (Get connection from pool)
DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext(env);

// do something useful with ctx

// Close the context when we're done
ctx.close();   // Return connection to pool

// Create another initial context (Get connection from pool)
DirContext ctx2 = new InitialDirContext(env);

// do something useful with ctx2

// Close the context when we're done
ctx2.close();   // Return connection to pool
</blockquote></pre>
<p>
This example creates two initial contexts in succession.
The second initial context will reuse the connection used by
the first.
To run this program and observe how the connections are retrieved
and returned to the pool, use the following command line.
<blockquote><pre>
#java -Dcom.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.debug=fine UsePool
</pre></blockquote>
This should produce output that looks as follows.
<blockquote><pre>
Create com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient@5d173[localhost:389]
Use com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient@5d173
{ou=ou: NewHires, objectclass=objectClass: top, organizationalUnit}
Release com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient@5d173
Use com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient@5d173
{ou=ou: People, objectclass=objectClass: top, organizationalunit}
Release com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapClient@5d173
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

You can decide when and
where to use pooling by including or omitting the
<tt>"com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool"</tt> property, and thus
control pooling on a <em>per-context</em> basis.
In the previous example, if you removed this property from the
environment properties before creating the second initial context,
the second initial context would not use a pooled connection.
The presence of this property in the environment also determines whether
pooled connections are used for referral handling and processing of LDAP URLs
passed to the initial context. For example, when this property
is present in the environment when the provider is processing a referral,
the provider will use a pooled connection for the referral.

<p>
The LDAP provider keeps track of whether a connection is being used
through indications from the application. It assumes that an
application that is maintaining an open context handle is using the
connection.  Therefore, in order for the LDAP provider to properly
manage the pooled connections, you must be diligent about
invoking <tt>Context.close()</tt> on contexts that you no longer need.

<p>
Bad connections are automatically detected and removed from the
pool by the LDAP provider. 
The probability of a context ending up with a bad connection is the
same regardless of whether connection pooling is used.

<a name=TIMEOUT><h4>Creation Timeout</h4></a>

The pool of connections maintained by the LDAP service provider may be
limited in size; this is described in detail in the <a
href=config.html>Connection Pooling Configuration</a> section.  When
connection pooling has been enabled and no pooled connection is
available, the client application will block, waiting for an available
connection.  You can use the <tt>"com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout"</tt>
environment property to specify how long to wait for a pooled connection.
If you omit this property, the application will wait indefinitely.
<p>
This same property is also used to specify a timeout period for establishment of 
the LDAP connection, as described in 
the <a href=create.html#TIMEOUT>Connection Creation</a> section.


<h4>When Not to Use Pooling</h4>

Pooled connections are intended to be reused. Therefore, 
if you plan to perform operations on a <tt>Context</tt> instance that might
alter the underlying connection's state, then you should not use connection
pooling for that <tt>Context</tt> instance.
For example, if you plan to invoke the Start TLS extended operation on
a <tt>Context</tt> instance, or plan to change security-related
properties (such as <tt>"java.naming.security.principal"</tt> or
<tt>"java.naming.security.protocol"</tt>) after the initial context has
been created, you should not use connection pooling for that
<tt>Context</tt> instance because the LDAP provider does not track any
such state changes.
If you use connection pooling in such situations, you might be
compromising the security of your application.
