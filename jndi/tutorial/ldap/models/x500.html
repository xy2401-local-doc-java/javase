<h2>
    X.500 Overview
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The X.500 directory service is a global directory service.  Its
components cooperate to manage information about objects such as
countries, organizations, people, machines, and so on in a
worldwide scope.  It provides the capability to look up
information by name (a <em>white-pages</em> service) and to browse
and search for information (a <em>yellow-pages</em> service).
<p>

The information is held in a <em>directory information base</em>
(DIB).  Entries in the DIB are arranged in a tree structure called
the <em>directory information tree</em> (DIT).  Each entry is a named
object and consists of a set of attributes.  Each attribute has a
defined attribute type and one or more values.  The directory schema
defines the mandatory and optional attributes for each class of object
(called the <em>object class</em>).  Each named object may have 
one or more object classes associated with it.
<p>

The X.500 namespace is hierarchical. An entry is unambiguously
identified by a <em>distinguished name</em> (DN).  A distinguished
name is the concatenation of selected attributes from each entry,
called the <em>relative distinguished name</em> (RDN), in the tree
along a path leading from the root down to the named entry.
<p>

Users of the X.500 directory may (subject to access control)
interrogate and modify the entries and attributes in the DIB.
<p>

For more information on the X.500, refer to the CCITT X.500
(1988/1993)/ISO Directory.

<h4>Naming Convention</h4>

Although the concepts of distinguished names and relative
distinguished names are core to the X.500 model, the X.500 standard
itself does not define any string representation for names.  What is
communicated between the X.500 components is the structural form of
names.  The reasoning behind this is that the standard is sufficient
to allow different implementations to interoperate.
String names are
never communicated between different implementations.  Instead, 
they are necessary only for interaction with end-users. For that
purpose, the standard allows any representation, not necessarily only
string representations.

<p>
Systems that are based on the X.500, such as the LDAP, the DCE
Directory, Novell's <a href="http://www.novell.com/nds/">NDS</a>, and
Microsoft's Active Directory, each define its own string
representation.  For example, in the LDAP, a DN's RDNs are arranged
right to left, separated by the comma character (",").  Here's an example
of a name that starts with <tt>"c=us"</tt> at the top and leads to
<tt>"cn=Rosanna Lee"</tt> at the leaf.

<blockquote><pre>
cn=Rosanna Lee, ou=People, o=Sun, c=us
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Here's an example of the same name using the string representation of
the DCE Directory and Microsoft's Active Directory.

<blockquote><pre>
/c=us/o=Sun/ou=People/cn=Rosanna Lee
</pre></blockquote>

The convention for these systems is that RDNs are ordered left to right
and separated by the forward slash character ("/").

<h4>Protocols</h4>

The X.500 standard defines a protocol (among others) for a
client application to access the X.500 directory.  Called the
<em>Directory Access Protocol</em> (DAP), it is layered on top of the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack.

<h4>Application Programming Interfaces</h4>

The X.500 standard itself does not define an API for accessing the
directory. Again, the X.500 standard is mainly concerned with
interoperability between directory clients and directory servers
and between different directory servers.
<p>
One standard API that has been defined for the X.500 is
the X/Open Specifications API to Directory Services (XDS),
a C language-based API that client programs use
for accessing X.500 directories.
