<h2>
    LDAP v3
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The LDAP v3 
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">RFC 2251</A>) 
is designed to address some of the limitations of the LDAP v2 in the areas of
internationalization, authentication, referral, and deployment.
It also allows new features to be added to the protocol
without also requiring changes to the protocol.  This is done by using
<em>extensions</em> and <em>controls</em>.

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
Internationalization is addressed via an international
character set (ISO 10646) to represent protocol elements that are
strings (such as DNs).
Version 3 also differs from version 2 in that it
uses UTF-8 to encode its strings.

<h4>Authentication</h4> 

The LDAP v2 supported three types of authentication: anonymous, simple
(clear-text password), and Kerberos v4.
<p>
The LDAP v3 uses the Simple Authentication
and Security Layer (SASL) authentication framework (<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">RFC 2222</A>) to allow
different authentication mechanisms to be used with the LDAP.
SASL specifies a challenge-response protocol in which data is
exchanged between the client and the server for the purposes of
authentication. 
<p>
Several SASL mechanisms are currently defined:
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt">DIGEST-MD5</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2195.txt">CRAM-MD5</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2245.txt">Anonymous</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">External</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">S/Key</a>,
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">GSSAPI</a>, and
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">Kerberos v4</a>.

An LDAP v3 client can use any of these SASL mechanisms,
provided that the LDAP v3 server supports them.  
Moreover, new (yet-to-be
defined) SASL mechanisms can be used without changes to the LDAP
having to be made.


<h4>Referrals</h4>

A <a href=../../getStarted/concepts/glossary.html#REFERRAL><em>referral</em></a>
is information that a server sends back to the client
indicating that the requested information can be found
at another location (possibly at another server).
In the LDAP v2, servers are supposed to handle referrals and not
return them to the client. This is because handling referrals
can be very complicated and therefore would result in 
more-complicated
clients.  As servers were built and deployed, referrals were
found to be useful, but
not many servers supported server-side referral handling.
So a way was found to retrofit the protocol to allow it to return
referrals. This was done by placing the referral inside of the error
message of a "partial result" error response.
<p>

The LDAP v3 has explicit support for referrals and allows servers to
return the referrals directly to the client.

<h4>Deployment</h4>

A common protocol such as the LDAP is useful for ensuring that all 
of the
directory clients and servers "speak the same language."  When many
different directory client applications and directory servers are
deployed in a network, it also is very useful for all of these entities
to talk about the same objects. For example, if applications
<em>App1</em> and <em>App2</em> both need to associate data with a
user, then it makes sense for the directory to have a common notion of
user that both applications can use rather than each going off and
defining its own.

<p> 

A <em>directory schema</em>
specifies, among other things, the types of objects that a
directory may have and the mandatory and optional attributes that each
type of object may have.  The LDAP v3 defines a schema 
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2252.txt">RFC 2252</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2256.txt">RFC 2256</A>) based on
the X.500 standard for common objects found in the network, such as countries,
localities, organizations, users/persons, groups, and devices. 
It
also defines a way for a client application to access the server's
schema so that it can find out the types of objects and
attributes that a particular server supports.
<p>

The LDAP v3 further defines a set of syntaxes for representing attribute values
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2252.txt">RFC 2252</A>).

<h4>Extensions</h4>

In addition to the repertoire of predefined operations, such as
"search" and "modify," the LDAP v3 defines an
<em>"extended" operation</em>.  The "extended" operation takes 
a request as an argument and returns a response. 
The request contains an identifier that
identifies the request and the arguments of the request.
The response contains the results of performing the request.  
The pair
of "extended" operation request/response is called an
<em>extension</em>.  For example, there can be an extension for 
Start TLS, which is a request for the client to the server to activate the
Start TLS protocol. 
<p>
These extensions can be standard (defined by the
LDAP community) or proprietary (defined by a particular directory
vendor).

<h4>Controls</h4>

Another way to add new features is by using a
<em>control</em>.  The LDAP v3 allows the behavior
of any operation to be modified through the use of controls.
Any number of controls may be sent along with an
operation, and any number of controls may be returned with its
results.  For example, you can send a Sort control along with a
"search" operation that tells the server to sort the results of the
search according to the <tt>"name"</tt> attribute.  
<p>
Like extensions, such
controls can be standard or proprietary.

<h4>Additional Differences</h4>

<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH="80%" >
<TR>
<TH>Operation/Feature</TH>

<TH>Description</TH>
</TR>

<tr>
<td>bind</td>
<td>
The "bind" operation is optional and can be sent multiple times during a
session.  If a client requests an operation to be performed without
doing an explicit bind, the client is treated as "anonymous."  The
client can also send a "bind" operation in the middle of a session to change 
the client's credentials (without sending an unbind first).
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>modify DN</td>
<td>
The "modify DN" operation allows you to rename an entry to any other part of the
namespace. (That is, you are not restricted to the same context, as is the
case of the LDAP v2).  The client specifies the DN of
the entry, the new RDN, and the (optional) DN of the new
parent for the new RDN.  If the optional DN of the new parent is not
specified, then the parent of the original entry is used.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>search filter</td>
<td>
The LDAP v3 defines an updated search filter representation
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt">RFC 2254</A>)
that supports the ISO 10646 character set, supports extensible matches,
and uses the UTF-8 encoding.
</tr>

<tr>
<td>operational attributes</td>
<td>
<em>Operational attributes</em> are maintained by servers for administrative
purposes. They are not visible to client applications unless
those applications explicitly ask for them.
They are used to hold such information as time stamps and
a <em>subschema subentry</em> 
(which is a pointer to schema information about the entry).
The LDAP v3 defines these operational attributes and subschema entries
and allows clients to access them.
</td>

<tr>
<td>LDAP URL</td>
<td>
The LDAP v3 defines 
an updated LDAP URL format
(<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2255.txt">RFC 2255</A>)
to support extensions.

<h4>LDAP v3 Compared to the X.500 Standard</h4>

<p>
The LDAP v3 has many more features than the LDAP v2 and therefore
departs from one of original goals of the LDAP v2 to have
small and simple clients. The LDAP v3 supports a larger subset
of the X.500 features than does the LDAP v2.
