<h2>
    Naming System Boundaries
</h2>

The
<a target="_top" href="../names/composite.html">What's in a Name?</a> <a target="_top" href="../names/composite.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>   lesson explains in detail how to use a composite name to express a
name that spans multiple naming systems.
This section explains how a service provider determines which components
of the composite name to process and which to pass on.
In effect, the service provider needs to determine the
<em>naming system boundary</em> that separates its components
from those of its (downstream) neighbor.


<h4>Strong and Weak Separation</h4>
<p>
The example in the
<a target="_top" href="../names/composite.html">What's in a Name?</a> <a target="_top" href="../names/composite.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>   lesson has the following composite name:
<blockquote><pre>
cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People/tutorial/report.txt
</pre></blockquote>
This composite name has three components: 
<blockquote><pre>
cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People
tutorial
report.txt
</pre></blockquote>
The first component belongs to the LDAP naming system, and the second
two belong to the (UNIX) file system. As
this example shows, a composite name can have multiple
(possibly consecutive) components from the same naming system
(<tt>"tutorial"</tt> and <tt>"report.txt"</tt> are both from the file
system), but one component cannot span more than one
naming system.
So, the correspondence between
the composite name component separator--the forward slash character (<tt>/</tt>)--and
naming system boundaries might not be one-to-one.
<p>
In this lesson, service providers are categorized
by whether they treat
the composite name component separator as a naming system boundary.
Those that do support <em>strong separation</em>,  and those that don't support <em>weak separation</em>.
<ul>
<li>
A provider that supports 
strong separation processes a composite name 
by consuming the leading
component of the name and leaving the remaining components for
other naming systems.
<li>
A provider that supports weak separation does not
necessarily treat the separator as a naming system
boundary. When processing a composite name, it consumes
as many leading components as appropriate for the underlying naming system.
</ul>
<p>

The primary factor for determining whether a provider supports strong
or weak separation is the syntax of the underlying naming system.  If
that system has a flat namespace or a
hierarchical namespace with a compound name component separator that
does not conflict with the composite name component separator, 
then the
corresponding service provider will support strong separation.
Otherwise, the provider most likely will support weak
separation.  Of course, it can get around the syntax
conflict issue and support strong separation by requiring that any
compound name component separator be escaped or quoted.
This requirement might be inconvenient for users of that provider
but it might be the only way by
which some providers can support federation.
(See later in this lesson.)

<p>
Service providers that support strong separation include those
for the LDAP, the Windows file system, and the RMI registry.
The LDAP naming system is hierarchical and has the comma character ("<tt>,</tt>")
as its compound name component separator.
The Windows file system is hierarchical and has the backslash character
("<tt>\</tt>") as the separator.
Neither of these separators
conflicts with the composite name component separator.
The RMI registry namespace is a flat namespace.
Service providers that support weak separation include
those for the COS naming service and the UNIX file system.

<h4>Conditions for Supporting Weak Separation</h4>

Weak separation is convenient because it makes composite names look cleaner
(fewer quotation marks or escapes are required). 
Also, this allows users to be less cognizant
of naming system boundaries.
However, not all service providers can support weak separation.
Certain restrictions may force a provider to
support strong separation.
For example,
if the namespace syntax is hierarchical and uses
the forward slash character ("<tt>/</tt>") as its separator but names
are arranged right to left, then the provider cannot use weak separation.
This is because
the conflicting direction prevents any sensible determination
of naming system boundaries.
<p>
If the naming system is terminal (components from that naming system
can appear only at the end of a composite name), then the service provider
can support weak separation.
For example, suppose that a spreadsheet application's namespace has a
left-to-right syntax and uses the forward slash character as the
component separator. Suppose also that it names spreadsheet cells
that will always be terminal; that is, things will not be
named relative
to a spreadsheet cell. In this case, the service provider for
the spreadsheet naming system can support weak separation.
Given a composite name, it will consume all of its components.
<p>
If the naming system is nonterminal but the service provider can determine
the naming system boundary syntactically, then it
can support weak separation.
In this case, the service provider would use a syntactic rule to determine
how many components from a composite name to consume.
For example, the compound name components from the naming system might
have a distinguishing characteristic that allows the provider
to select the components. 
<p>
As a specific example, a DCE X.500
name looks like this:
<blockquote><pre>
c=us/o=wiz/ou=people
</pre></blockquote>
A provider for this naming system can support weak separation
by looking for components that have a key/value pair separated
by an equals character ("<tt>=</tt>").
It will, however, restrict the types of
naming systems that can be federated directly beyond its
naming system.
In the previous example, a naming system
that has names that consist of key/value pairs separated by an equals character cannot be federated.
<p>
If the naming system is nonterminal but the service provider can determine
the naming system boundary dynamically, then it can support
weak separation.
The underlying naming system must be able to return residual 
unresolved components of names.
To determine which components to consume, the provider 
will resolve
the entire composite name and, based on the result of 
the resolution,
use any residual to determine what is not in its naming system.
