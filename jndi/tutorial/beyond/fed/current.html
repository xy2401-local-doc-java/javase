<h2>
    The Current Naming System 
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Regardless of whether a service provider supports strong
or weak separation, once it has determined the 
components of the composite name that it should process,
it needs to process them.
How it does this depends on whether its 
participation in the name's resolution
is as an intermediate naming system or a terminal naming system.
<p>
An <em>intermediate naming system</em> is a naming system
that is involved only in the
resolution of the composite name. 
It is responsible for passing on the
operation to its target context.  The 
<em>terminal</em> (or <em>target</em>) <em>naming
system</em> is the system that contains the context in which the operation is
carried out. In other words, the terminal naming system is 
the system named
by the tail component(s) of a composite name.
In the following sample composite name:
<blockquote><pre>
cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People/tutorial/report.txt
</pre></blockquote>
the LDAP directory is an intermediate naming system
and is responsible for resolving the name
<tt>"cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People"</tt>.
The UNIX file system is the terminal or target naming system
and is responsible for performing the requested context
operation on the name <tt>"tutorial/report.txt"</tt>.
<p>
Processing for a terminal naming system is not very interesting.
The provider merely carries out the requested context operation.
For example, if the context method invoked was 
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#list(javax.naming.Name)"><tt>Context.list()</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#list(javax.naming.Name)"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>, then the service provider would invoke <tt>list()</tt>, using
its components from the composite name, as 
if it was not in a federation and then return the results of <tt>list()</tt>
to the caller.
<p>
By contrast,
processing for an intermediate naming system is much more interesting.
The provider's job is to
determine the reference to the <em>next naming system</em>, or <em>nns</em>, when given
its components from the composite name.
This reference is called the <em>next naming system pointer</em>,
or <em>nns pointer</em>.
In the previous example, the LDAP provider must determine the nns pointer
for the LDAP name <tt>"cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People"</tt>.

<h4>Retrieving NNS Pointers</h4>
A service provider can support retrieval of the nns pointer
in either of two ways.
One way is to use an explicitly
named nns pointer, also called a <em>junction</em>.
The second way is via an <em>implicit</em> nns pointer.

<p><em><strong>Junctions</strong></em>
<p>

A <em>junction</em> is a binding of a name to an nns pointer;
in the previous example,
<tt>"cn=homedir,cn=Jon Ruiz,ou=People"</tt>
is a junction. This name is bound to a reference to a file system context.
If you perform a 
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#lookup(javax.naming.Name)"><tt>Context.lookup()</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#lookup(javax.naming.Name)"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>  on the name,
then you will get back not an LDAP entry but
a <tt>Context</tt> instance for a directory (<tt>/tmp</tt>) in the file system.
<p>
A context may have an unlimited number of junctions.
Moreover,
a junction is usually indistinguishable from other normal (nonjunction)
names in the context, although this
depends on the naming policy of the underlying naming system.


<p><em><strong>Implicit NNS Pointers</strong></em><p>

A service provider also can support retrieval of the nns
pointer via an <em>implicit</em> nns pointer.
An implicit nns pointer is named by using the
composite name component separator ("<tt>/</tt>").
Suppose the name <tt>"corp.wiz.com"</tt> names an object in the
current naming system.
Then the name <tt>"corp.wiz.com/"</tt> will
name its nns pointer.
<p>
An implicit nns pointer is used when a naming system's native entries cannot
or should not be used directly to hold an nns pointer.
It can be determined <em>statically</em> or <em>dynamically</em>.
<p>
<em>Static Implicit NNS Pointers.</em>
A static implicit nns pointer is constructed by using
data found in the current naming system.
For example, suppose that you store nns pointers in the
DNS by using TXT records. 
When the DNS provider processes the name
<tt>"corp.wiz.com/"</tt>, it will use the data in the TXT record
of the <tt>"corp.wiz.com"</tt> entry to construct the nns pointer.
<p>
<em>Dynamic Implicit NNS Pointers.</em>
An implicit nns pointer can also be determined dynamically, based
on the types and content of the objects bound in the current naming
system.
This is useful when the result of resolving 
a composite name's components
in the current naming system does not indicate any nns information.
The only conclusion that the service provider can draw is that
resolution was completed in the current naming system
and should proceed to the next naming system.
<p>
For example, suppose that the composite name <tt>"lib/xyz.zip/part1/abc"</tt>
consists of two parts: <tt>"lib/xyz.zip"</tt> and <tt>"part1/abc"</tt>.
<tt>"lib/xyz.zip"</tt> names a file in the ZIP format, and
<tt>"part1/abc"</tt> names an entry in the ZIP file.
The resolution of <tt>"lib/xyz.zip"</tt> results in a file object
and does not indicate which nns to use for continuing the
operation on <tt>"part1/abc"</tt>.
<p>
To support a dynamic implicit nns pointer, the JNDI defines a special
<a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html"><tt>Reference</tt></a><a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a> called an <em>nns reference</em>.
This reference has an address type <tt>"nns"</tt>
and an address content that is the resolved object.
In the ZIP file example, the resolved object is the ZIP file itself
and the file system service provider would construct an nns reference as
follows.
<blockquote><pre>
Reference ref = new Reference("java.io.File",
    new RefAddr("nns") {
	public Object getContent() {
	    return theFile;
	}
    });
</pre></blockquote>
