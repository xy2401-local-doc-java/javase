<h2>
    Naming Policies
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As mentioned earlier in this lesson,
the JNDI is defined independent of any specific naming and directory
service implementation. This allows a variety of naming and directory
systems to be accessed in a common way. However, for it
to offer true
independence, common policies are required that specify
<em>how</em> the naming and directory should be used.  Without these
policies, you might be able to use the same API to access the data,
but how you find and use that data would still be
directory-dependent.  The lack of policy is a problem not only for
multiple naming and directory systems, but also for single
naming/directory systems such as the LDAP.
Without general agreement on how the data in the directory
is to be organized and used,
a single system can easily deteriorate into an unmanageable mess.
For example, suppose that two applications need to associated data with a
user in an enterprise. If each application chooses its own
policy of how to name and represent a user in the directory, then
the directory will contain two representations of the same user.
Furthermore, users of each application will have to learn each
representation and how to name it.

<h4>Types of Policies</h4>

There are two categories of policies:
<ul>
<li>Naming policies that specify how objects are named relative to each
other and the common names to use.
<li>Directory policies, called 
<a href=../../getStarted/concepts/glossary.html#SCHEMA><em>schema</em></a>,
that specify the attributes
that objects in the directory
should have and the names and syntaxes of those attributes.
</ul>

The LDAP defines attribute syntaxes
(<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2252.txt">RFC 2252</a>) and
user-related schema
(<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2256.txt">RFC 2256</a>).
Many other proposals for specifying other domain-specific schema
are available, such as for mail and security. 
In addition, efforts are underway to standardize
the schema across different directory systems
(see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt">RFC 2307</a>).
Further, several proprietary schemas have emerged in the LDAP space
from  vendors such as <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>
and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>.
Some applications that are based on servers from those vendors have
dependencies on the proprietary schemas.
<p>
In the naming policy area, naming policies have been defined
in the X.500. Most LDAP systems follow a common naming convention
at the higher levels of the naming tree (for example, how to 
name countries, organizations, and departments).
Less agreement exists on lower levels.
However, some servers, such as the Active Directory from Microsoft,
have defined their own naming policies.
<p>
The DNS has defined naming policies at the higher levels of
the naming tree.
It is used primarily to name machines and domains on
the Internet and Intranet 
so naming policies for other entities are less relevant.
<p>
In terms of a composite naming policy, the HTTP and FTP URLs
have set the de facto standard. Namely, the first component of the URL
names the host/domain using the DNS.
After the first component, there is a
proprietary namespace underneath.

<h4>The Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition Naming Policies</h4>

The JNDI does not define any naming policy on its own.
However, one important platform that does define a limited
set of naming policies for using the JNDI is the
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/">Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition</A> (J2EE<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup>).
It defines a logical namespace that application components (such as 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb">Enterprise JavaBeans</a>,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlets">servlets</a>, and 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp">JavaServer Pages</a> (JSP)) can use
to name resources, components, and other data.
The namespace is provided to a component by its <em>container</em>, the
entity that executes the component.
Typically, a component has a <em>deployment descriptor</em> that contains,
among other data, information about the logical names and types of
resources and components that the component needs or references.
An administrator, using information from the deployment descriptor,
maps the logical namespace to bindings in
the namespace of the actual environment into which the component 
is being deployed. 
The container uses this mapping to present the logical namespace
to the component. See the J2EE specification for details.
<p>
The enterprise namespace is rooted in a URL context for the
<tt>java</tt> URL scheme. For example, you might use a name such as
<tt>"java:comp/env/jdbc/Salary"</tt> from the initial context
to name the Salary database.
Details about URL contexts are discussed in the
<a target="_top" href="../url/initctx.html">URLs</a> <a target="_top" href="../url/initctx.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>    lesson.
By using a URL context,
the policy avoids any conflicts with names in the initial context
configured by the
<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY><tt>Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>    environment property.

<p>
At the root context of the namespace is a binding with the name <tt>"comp"</tt>,
which is bound to a subtree reserved for component-related bindings.
The name <tt>"comp"</tt> is short for component.
There are no other bindings at the root context.
However, the root context is reserved for the future expansion
of the policy, 
specifically for naming resources that are tied not to the component itself
but to other types of entities such as users or departments.
For example, future policies might allow you to name users
and organizations/departments by using names such as
<tt>"java:user/alice"</tt> and <tt>"java:org/engineering"</tt>.
<p>
In the <tt>"comp"</tt> context, there are two bindings: <tt>"env"</tt> and
<tt>"UserTransaction"</tt>.
The name <tt>"env"</tt> is bound to a subtree that is reserved for the component's 
environment-related bindings, as defined by its deployment descriptor.
<tt>"env"</tt> is short for environment.
The J2EE recommends (but does not require) the following structure
for the <tt>"env"</tt> namespace.
<ul>
<li>Enterprise JavaBeans<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> are placed under the <tt>"ejb"</tt> subtree.
For example, a Payroll EJB might be named 
<tt>"java:comp/env/ejb/Payroll"</tt>.
<li>Resource factory references 
are placed in subtrees differentiated by their resource manager type.
Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li><tt>"jdbc"</tt> for JDBC<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> DataSource references
<li><tt>"jms"</tt> for JMS connection factories
<li><tt>"mail"</tt> for JavaMail connection factories
<li><tt>"url"</tt> for URL connection factories
</ul>
For example, a JDBC Salary database might have the name
<tt>"java:comp/env/jdbc/Salary"</tt>.
</ul>
The <tt>"env"</tt> context might also contain bindings for other
types of configuration data (such as strings and 
wrappers around primitive data types)
that the component needs, 
as defined in the component's deployment descriptor.
No policy is recommended or required for these bindings;
they can be placed at the root of the <tt>"env"</tt> context or
be partitioned by subtrees based on their logical relationships
or types. For example, you might have bindings for a string and a numeric
parameter that are named using 
<tt>"java:comp/env/CompanyName"</tt> and <tt>"java:comp/env/PrimeRate"</tt>,
respectively.
<p>
The name
<tt>"UserTransaction"</tt> is bound to a
<tt>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</tt> object. The component that looks up this
object from the namespace (by using the name <tt>"java:comp/UserTransaction"</tt>)
can use it to start, commit, or abort transactions.
