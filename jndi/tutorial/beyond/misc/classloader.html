<h2>
    Class Loading
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The JNDI is an API defined independent of any specific naming
or directory service implementation. 
For an application,
applet, servlet, or any program unit to use the JNDI,
it must specify the service provider to use and have access
to the provider's class files.
A single program might use more than one provider.
Furthermore, the program and/or providers might use
<a href=../../getStarted/concepts/glossary.html#OF>object factories</a>,
<a href=../../getStarted/concepts/glossary.html#SF>state factories</a>, and
<a href=../../getStarted/concepts/glossary.html#CF>control factories</a>,
all of whose class files must also be made available to the JNDI.
In addition, the JNDI needs access to application resource files (see the

<a target="_top" href="../env/source.html#APPRES">Application Resource Files</a> <a target="_top" href="../env/source.html#APPRES"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>    section)
provided by the program, providers, and other components.
In all of these cases, the JNDI needs to load in class and resource files.
This section explains how the JNDI uses class loaders and how you can
affect its use of them.

<h4>Background on Class Loaders</h4>

The class loader is the means by which Java<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> classes and resources are
loaded into the JRE. It controls the policies
ranging from where to load class definitions to the data format of the class
definitions. 
<p>
In the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/>JDK<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup> 1.1</a>
and earlier releases, 
no relationship exists between various class loaders.
A system class loader responsible for loading in the Java runtime,
the application, and classes and resources in the application's classpath.
An applet class loader is responsible
for loading the applets and their related classes and resources, possibly
over the network by communicating with a Web server.
<p>
In the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/>Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2</a>
and later releases, class loaders
have a hierarchical relationship.
Each class loader has a parent class loader.
When a class loader is asked to load a class or resource, it 
consults its parent class loader before attempting to load the item itself.
The parent in turn consults its parent, and so on.
So it is only after <em>all</em> of the ancestor class loaders
cannot find the item that the current class loader gets involved.
<p>
A <em>bootstrap class loader</em> is responsible for loading in
the Java runtime. It is the "root" in the class loader hierarchy.
The system class loader is a descendant of the bootstrap class loader.
It is responsible for loading in the application,
as well as for loading
classes and resources in the application's classpath.
<p>
The Java 2 platform also introduced the notion of
<em>context class loader</em>.
A thread's context class loader is, by default, set to the context
class loader of the thread's parent. The hierarchy of threads is
rooted at the primordial thread (the one that runs the program).
The context class loader of the primordial thread is set to the class loader
that loaded the application. So unless you explicitly change
the thread's context class loader, its context class loader
will be the application's class loader. That is, the context class loader
can load the classes that the application can load.
This loader is used by the Java runtime such as the RMI
(Java Remote Method Invocation) 
to load classes and resources on behalf
of the user application.
The context class loader, like any Java 2 platform class loader, 
has a parent class loader
and supports the same delegation model for class loading described previously.

<h4>Class Loading on the JDK 1.1 Software</h4>
When you use the JNDI with the JDK 1.1 software, 
you must place the JNDI JARs,
service provider JARs, 
and JARs or class files containing factories
in the application's classpath.
If you're using an applet, then 
you must place those JARs and class files
in the applet's codebase directory and/or archive locations.
Consequently, the class loader that loads the JNDI 
JARs is typically the
same as the one that loads in the application and the factories.

<p>
Note that you cannot use JNDI application resource files with
the JDK 1.1 software. See the
<a target="_top" href="../env/source.html#APPRES">Application Resource Files</a> <a target="_top" href="../env/source.html#APPRES"><img src="../../jndiimages/beyondIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Beyond the Basics trail)"></a>   section for details.

<h4>Class Loading on the Java 2 Platform</h4>

When you use the JNDI with the Java 2 platform,
the class loader that loads the JNDI classes typically differs
from the one that loads in the application.
For example, in the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>,
the JNDI classes are loaded by the bootstrap class loader whereas
the application classes are loaded by the system class loader.
In the Java 2 SDK, v1.2, if you install the JNDI as an installed extension,
then the JNDI classes are loaded by the class loader responsible
for loading installed extensions, whereas the application
classes are loaded by the system class loader.
As a result, if the JNDI were to use its class loader to
load service providers and factories, then it might not see
the same classes as the application.
Therefore, to try to see what the application can see, 
the JNDI uses the calling thread's context class loader
when it is loading in classes for the service providers, factories,
and application resource files.
<p>
In rare circumstances, you want to
change a thread's context class loader to affect how the JNDI finds classes.
This might occur, for example, when the environment that
you're working in does not set the context class loader properly.
For example, a bug in the
<a href=http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/>Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.2.2</a> 
causes the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) 
not to set the listener threads'
context class loader to be the class loader that loaded the applet.
Consequently, callback methods invoked by the listener threads
do not have access to service providers and factories that
the applet can otherwise load explicitly.
Or, you might want to add an additional repository of JARs and class files
that contains special providers and factories
to your applications/applets.
To change a thread's context class loader, 
you use <tt>Thread.setContextClassLoader()</tt>.
<p>
Here is <a href=src/ChangeLoader.java>an example</a>.
<blockquote><pre>
ClassLoader prevCl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();

// Create the class loader by using the given URL
// Use prevCl as parent to maintain current visibility
ClassLoader urlCl = 
    URLClassLoader.newInstance(new URL[]{new URL(url)}, prevCl);

try {
    // Save the class loader so that you can restore it later
    Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(urlCl);

    // Expect that the environment properties are in the
    // application resource file found at "url"
    Context ctx = new InitialContext();

    System.out.println(ctx.lookup("tutorial/report.txt"));

    // Do something useful with ctx
    ...
} catch (NamingException e) {
    // Handle the exception
} finally {
    // Restore
    Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(prevCl);
}
</pre></blockquote>
This example creates a <tt>URLClassLoader</tt>
that loads classes from a specified codebase URL.
It then creates an initial context and performs other JNDI operations
within the context of that class loader.
In this example, the class loader affects how the
initial context was initialized (via an application resource file
found by the new class loader), as well as the result of
<tt>lookup()</tt> (via the object factory named in the application resource
file and the class file of the factory found by the new class loader).
To run this program, you supply a codebase URL as follows:
<blockquote><pre>
# java ChangeClassLoader file:/some/directory/somewhere/
</blockquote></pre>
In that codebase, you can specify a 
<tt>jndi.properties</tt> file.
In particular example,  the following 
<a href=src/somewhere/jndi.properties><tt>jndi.properties</tt> file</a>
is in the codebase directory.
<blockquote><pre>
java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.FSContextFactory
java.naming.provider.url=file:/tmp
java.naming.factory.object=FooObjectFactory
</pre></blockquote>
In the same codebase directory is the class definition
for <a href=src/somewhere/FooObjectFactory.java><tt>FooObjectFactory</tt></a>,
which when given a <tt>java.io.File</tt> object
always returns the string <tt>"foo"</tt>. 
When you run this program, you see this output:
<blockquote><pre>
foo
</pre></blockquote>
If you do not see this output, then check the correctness of the codebase URL argument.
Remember, if you are naming a codebase directory, 
then you should include a trailing forward
slash character in the URL.


<h4>Class Loading from Prespecified Locations</h4>

In some cases, the location of class files is specified explicitly.
For example, you can specify an object factory's codebase in its
<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html><tt>Reference</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>. 
When the JNDI reads such an object from the naming or directory service,
it will use a class loader for
the codebase named in the <tt>Reference</tt>
to obtain the class files for the factory. 
The parent of that class loader is the thread's context class loader.
