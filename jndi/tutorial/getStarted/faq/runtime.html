<h2>
    Runtime Problems
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Here are the most common problems that you might encounter
when you try to run a successfully compiled program
that uses the JNDI classes.

<h4>Class Not Found</h4>
<p>
<em>Problem</em>: You get a <tt>NoClassDefFoundError</tt> when running your program.
<p>
<em>Cause</em>: You did not include the JNDI classes (<tt>jndi.jar</tt>)
in your classpath, or you did not install the JNDI classes properly.
<p>
<em>Solution</em>:
The
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>
already include the JNDI classes so if you are using this version
you should not get this error.
<p>
If you are not using the 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>,
then the way you that include the JNDI classes your
<em>execution</em> environment depends on the
environment.
If you are using the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/">Java 2 SDK, v1.2</a>,
then make sure that <tt>jndi.jar</tt>
is in the <em>JAVA_HOME</em><tt>/jre/lib/ext</tt> directory,
where <em>JAVA_HOME</em> is the directory that contains the 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
Note that on some platforms, separate <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt> directories exist
for the JRE and the SDK. Make sure that the JNDI JARs have been
installed in both <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt> directories.
If you are using the <tt>java</tt> interpreter from the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">JDK 1.1</a>, 
then add the JARs either
to your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable or to the
<tt>-classpath</tt> option in your <tt>java</tt> command line.
<p>
For an applet, you need to make the JNDI and provider classes
available to that applet (for example, by adding them to the
<tt>archive</tt> option).

<h4>No Initial Context</h4>

<p>
<em>Problem</em>: You get a <tt>NoInitialContextException</tt>.
<p>
<em>Cause</em>: You did not specify which implementation to use
for the initial context.
Specifically, the

<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY><tt>Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>     environment property was not set to the class name of the factory 
that will create the initial context. 
Or, you did not make available to the program
the classes of the service provider named
by <tt>Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY</tt>.

<p>
<em>Solution</em>:
Set the <tt>Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY</tt> environment property to
the class name of the initial context implementation that you are using.
See 
<a target="_top" href="../../basics/prepare/initial.html">The Basics</a> <a href="../../basics/prepare/initial.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/basicsIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Basics trail)"></a>     trail for details.
<p>
If the property was set, then make sure that the class name was not mistyped,
and that the class named is available to your program
(either in its classpath or installed in the <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt> directory of the JRE).
The
<a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3>Java 2 SDK, v1.3</a>
includes service providers for LDAP, COS naming, and the RMI registry.
All other service providers must be installed and added to the
execution environment.

<h4>Connection Refused</h4>

<p>
<em>Problem</em>: You get a <tt>CommunicationException</tt>, indicating
"connection refused."
<p>
<em>Cause</em>: 
The server and port identified by the
<tt>Context.PROVIDER_URL</tt>
environment property is not being served by the server.
Perhaps someone has disabled or turned off the machine on which
the server is running.
Or, maybe you mistyped the server's name or port number.

<p><em>Solution</em>:
Check that there is indeed a server running on that port,
and restart the server if necessary.
The way that you perform this check depends on the LDAP server that you are using.
Usually, an administrative console or tool is available that you
can use to administer the server. You may use that tool to verify
the server's status.

<h4>Connection Fails</h4>
<em>Problem</em>: The LDAP server responds to other utilities
(such as its administration console) but does not seem to respond
to your program's requests.

<p>
<em>Cause</em>: The server does not respond to LDAP v3 connection
requests.
Some servers (especially public servers) do not respond correctly
to the LDAP v3, ignoring the requests instead of rejecting them.
Also, some LDAP v3 servers have problems handling a control
that Sun's LDAP service provider automatically sends and often return a server-specific failure code.

<p> <em>Solution</em>.  Try setting the environment property
<tt>"java.naming.ldap.version"</tt> to <tt>"2"</tt>.  The LDAP service provider by
default attempts to connect to an LDAP server using the LDAP v3;
if that fails, then it uses the LDAP v2.  
If the server silently ignores the v3 request, then the
provider will assume that the request worked.  To work around such
servers, you must explicitly set the protocol version to ensure proper
behavior by the server.
<p>
If the server is a v3 server, then try setting the following environment
property before creating the initial context:
<blockquote>
<pre>
env.put(Context.REFERRAL, "throw");
</pre>
</blockquote>
This will turn off the control that the LDAP provider sends automatically.
(See the
<a target="_top" href="../../ldap/referral/index.html">Referrals</a> <a href="../../ldap/referral/index.html"><img src="../../jndiimages/ldapIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Tips for LDAP Users trail)"></a>     lesson for details.)


<H4>Program Hangs</h4>

<p><em>Problem</em>: The program hangs.

<p><em>Causes</em>:
Some servers (especially public ones)
won't respond (not even with a negative answer) if you attempt
to perform a search that would generate too many results or
that would require the server to
examine too many entries in order to generate the answer.
Such servers are trying to limit the amount of resources that
they expend on a per-request basis.
<p>
Or, you tried to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) against
a server/port that does not support it, and vice versa
(that is, you tried to use a plain socket to talk to an SSL port).

<p><em>Solution</em>:
If your program is hanging because the server is trying
to restrict the use of its resources,
then retry your request using a query that will return a single 
result or only a few results.
This will help you to determine whether the server is alive.
If it is, then you can broaden your initial query and resubmit it.
<p>
If your program is hanging because of SSL problems,
then you need to find out whether the port is an SSL port and then
set the 
<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_PROTOCOL><tt>Context.SECURITY_PROTOCOL</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_PROTOCOL><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>     environment property appropriately.
If the port is an SSL port, then this property should be set to <tt>"ssl"</tt>.
If it is not an SSL port, then this property should not be set.


<h4>Name Not Found</h4>

<p><em>Problem</em>: You get a <tt>NameNotFoundException</tt>.

<p><em>Causes</em>:
When you initialized the initial context for the LDAP, you supply a 
root-distinguished name. For example, if you set the 
<tt>Context.PROVIDER_URL</tt>
environment property for the initial context
to <tt>"ldap://ldapserver:389/o=JNDITutorial"</tt>
and subsequently supplied a name such as <tt>"cn=Joe,c=us"</tt>,
then the full name that you passed to the LDAP service was
<tt>"cn=Joe,c=us,o=JNDITutorial"</tt>. 
If this was really the name that you intended, 
then you should check your server 
to make sure that it contains such an entry.
<p>
Also, the SunONE and Netscape Directory Servers return this error if you
supply an incorrect distinguished name for authentication purposes.
For example, 
the LDAP provider will throw  a
<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/NameNotFoundException.html><tt>NameNotFoundException</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/NameNotFoundException.html><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>    if you set the
<a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_PRINCIPAL><tt>Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL</tt></a><a target="_top" href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/naming/Context.html#SECURITY_PRINCIPAL><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the API reference documentation)"></a>     environment property to <tt>"cn=Admin, o=Tutorial"</tt>,
and <tt>"cn=Admin, o=Tutorial"</tt> is not an entry on the LDAP server.
The correct error for the SunONE and Netscape Directory Servers to return
actually should be something related to authentication, 
rather than "name not found."

<p><em>Solution</em>:
Verify the name that you supplied is that of 
an entry existing on the server. You can do this by listing 
the entry's parent context or using some other tool such
as the directory server's administration console.
