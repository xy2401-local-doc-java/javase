<h2>
    Naming Concepts
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

A fundamental facility in any computing system is the <em>naming
service</em>--the means by which names are associated with objects
and objects are found based on their names.  When using almost any
computer program or system, you are always naming one object or
another.  For example, when you use an electronic mail system, you
must provide the name of the recipient to whom you want to send mail.
To access a file in the computer, you must supply its name. A naming
service allows you to look up an object given its name.  

<p>
A naming service's primary function is to map
people-friendly names to objects, such as addresses, identifiers, or objects
typically used by computer programs.
For example, 
the 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt">
Internet Domain Name System (DNS)</a>
maps machine names (such as <tt>www.sun.com</tt>)
to IP addresses (such as <tt>192.9.48.5</tt>).
A file system maps a filename (for example, <tt>c:\bin\autoexec.bat</tt>)
to a file handle that a program can use to access the
contents of the file.
These two examples also illustrate the wide range of scale
at which naming services exist--from naming an object on the Internet
to naming a file on the local file system.

<h4>Names</h4>
<p>
To look up an object in a naming system, you supply it the
<em>name</em> of the object.
The naming system determines the syntax that the name must follow.
This syntax is sometimes called the naming system's <em>naming convention</em>.


<p>
For example, the UNIX<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> file system's
naming convention is that a file is named from its path
relative to the root of the file system, with each component in
the path separated from left to right using the forward slash character ("/").
The UNIX pathname, <tt>/usr/hello</tt>, for example, names a file
<tt>hello</tt> in the file directory <tt>usr</tt>, which is located 
in the root of the file system.


<p>
The DNS naming convention calls for components in the DNS name
to be ordered from right to left and delimited by the dot character (".").
Thus the DNS name <tt>sales.Wiz.COM</tt> names a DNS entry with the name
<tt>sales</tt>, relative to the DNS entry <tt>Wiz.COM</tt>. The DNS entry
<tt>Wiz.COM</tt>, in turn, names an entry with the name <tt>Wiz</tt> in
the <tt>COM</tt> entry.

<p>
The 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</a>
naming convention orders components from right to left,
delimited by the comma character (",").
Thus the LDAP name <tt>cn=Rosanna Lee, o=Sun, c=US</tt>
names an LDAP entry <tt>cn=Rosanna Lee</tt>, relative to the
entry <tt>o=Sun</tt>, which in turn, is relative to <tt>c=us</tt>.
The LDAP has the further rule that each component of the name must be
a name/value pair with the name and value separated by an equals character ("=").

<h4>Bindings</h4>

The association of a name with an object is called a
<em>binding</em>.
For example, a file name is <em>bound</em> to a file.
<p>
The DNS contains bindings that map machine names to IP addresses.
An LDAP name is bound to an LDAP entry.

<h4>References and Addresses</h4>
<a name=REF></a>
<p> 

Depending on the
naming service, some objects cannot be stored directly;
that is, a copy of the object cannot be placed inside
the naming service. Instead, they must be stored by
reference; that is, a <em>pointer</em> or <em>reference</em>
to the object is placed inside the naming service.
A reference is information about how to access an object.
Typically, it is a much more compact representation that can
be used to communicate with the object, while the object 
itself might contain more state information. Using the
reference, you can contact the object and obtain more
information about the object.
<p>

For example, an
airplane object might contain a list of the airplane's passengers and crew, its
flight plan, and fuel and instrument status, and its flight number and departure time.  By contrast, an airplane
object reference might contain only its flight number and departure
time.  The reference is a much more compact
representation of information about the airplane object and can be used to obtain additional information.
A file object, for example, is accessed using a <em>file reference</em>, also called a
<em>file handle</em>.  A printer object, for example,
might contain the state of the printer, such as its current queue and the
amount of paper in the paper tray. A printer object reference, on the other hand, might
contain only information on how to reach the printer, such as its
print server name and printing protocol.  
<p>
Although in general a reference can contain any arbitrary
information, it is useful to refer to its contents as
<em>addresses</em> (or communication end points): specific
information about how to access the object.  
<p>
For simplicity, this tutorial uses "object" to refer
to both objects and object references when a distinction
between the two is not required.

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>
A <em>context</em> is a set of name-to-object bindings.
Every context has an associated naming convention.
A context provides a lookup (<em>resolution</em>) operation that
returns the object and may provide operations such as those
for binding names, unbinding names, and listing bound names.
A name in one context object can be bound to another
context object (called a <em>subcontext</em>) that has the same naming convention.
<p>
For example, a file directory, such as <tt>/usr</tt>,
in the UNIX file system is a context. 
A file directory named relative to another file directory
is a subcontext (some UNIX users refer to this as a <em>subdirectory</em>).
That is, in a file directory <tt>/usr/bin</tt>,
the directory <tt>bin</tt> is a subcontext of <tt>usr</tt>.
In another example, 
a DNS domain, such as <tt>COM</tt>, is a context.
A DNS domain named relative to another DNS domain is a subcontext.
For example, in the DNS domain <tt>Sun.COM</tt>,
the DNS domain <tt>Sun</tt> is a subcontext of <tt>COM</tt>.
<p>
Finally, an LDAP entry, such as <tt>c=us</tt>, is a context.
An LDAP entry named relative to another LDAP entry
is a subcontext.
For example, in the an LDAP entry <tt>o=sun,c=us</tt>,
the entry <tt>o=sun</tt> is a subcontext of <tt>c=us</tt>.

<h4>Naming Systems and Namespaces</h4>
<p>
A <em>naming system</em> is a connected set of contexts of the
same type (they have the same naming convention) and provides
a common set of operations.
<p>
For example, a system that implements the DNS is a naming system. 
A system that communicates using the LDAP is a naming system.
<p>
A naming system provides a <em>naming service</em> to its
customers for performing naming-related operations.
A naming service is accessed through its own interface.  
For example, the DNS offers a
naming service that maps machine names to IP addresses.
The LDAP offers a naming service that maps LDAP names to LDAP entries.
A file system offers a naming service that maps filenames
to files and directories.
<p>

A <em>namespace</em> is the set of names in a naming system.
For example, the UNIX file system has a namespace consisting
of all of the names of files and directories in that file system.
The DNS namespace contains names of DNS domains and entries.
The LDAP namespace contains names of LDAP entries.
