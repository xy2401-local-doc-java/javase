<h2>
    Directory Concepts
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Many naming services are extended with a <em>directory service</em>.
A directory service associates names with objects and also allows such objects to have <em>attributes</em>.
Thus, you not only can look up an object by its name but also
get the object's attributes or search for the object based on its attributes.
<p>
An example is the telephone company's directory service.
It maps a subscriber's name to his address and phone number.
A computer's directory service is very much like a telephone company's
directory service in that both can be used to store information such
as telephone numbers and addresses.  The computer's
directory service is much more powerful, however, because
it is available online
and can be used to store a variety of information that 
can be utilized by
users, programs, and even the computer itself and
other computers.
<p>

A <em>directory object</em> represents an 
object in a computing environment.
A directory object can be used, for example, to represent a printer,
a person, a computer, or a network.
A directory object contains <em>attributes</em>
that describe the object that it represents.

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<p>

A directory object can have <em>attributes</em>.
For example, a printer might be represented by a directory
object that has as attributes its speed, resolution, and color.  A
user might be represented by a directory object that has as
attributes the user's e-mail address, various telephone numbers, postal
mail address, and computer account information.  
<p>
An attribute has an
<em>attribute identifier</em> and a set of <em>attribute values</em>.
An attribute identifier is a token that identifies an
attribute independent of its values.
For example, two different computer accounts might have
a <tt>"mail"</tt> attribute; <tt>"mail"</tt> is the attribute
identifier. An attribute value is the contents of
the attribute.
The email
address, for example, might have an attribute identifier of 
<tt>"mail"</tt> and the attribute
value of <tt>"john.smith@somewhere.com"</tt>.

<h4>Directories and Directory Services</h4>
A <em>directory</em> is a connected set of directory objects.
A <em>directory service</em> is a service that
provides operations for creating,
adding, removing, and modifying the attributes associated with 
objects in a directory.
The service is accessed through its own interface.
<p>
Many examples of directory services are possible.
The 
<a href="http://www.novell.com/nds/">Novell Directory Service</a> (NDS)
is a directory service from Novell that
provides information about many networking services, such as
the file and print services.
Network Information Service (NIS) is a directory service available
on the Solaris operating system for storing system-related information,
such as that relating to machines, networks, printers, and users.
The SunONE Directory Server is a general-purpose directory service
based on the Internet standard 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt">LDAP</a>.

<h4>Searches and Search Filters</h4>

You can look up a directory object by supplying its name
to the directory service.
Alternatively, many directories, such as those based on the LDAP,
support the notion of <em>searches</em>.
When you search, you can supply not a name but a query 
consisting of a logical expression in which you specify
the attributes
that the object or objects must have.
The query is called a <em>search filter</em>.
This style of searching is sometimes called <em>reverse lookup</em> or
<em>content-based searching</em>.
The directory service searches for and returns the objects that satisfy the
search filter.
<p>
For example, you can query the directory service to find
all users that have the attribute <tt>"age"</tt> greater than 40 years.
Similarly, you can query it to find
all machines whose IP address starts with "192.113.50".

<h4>Combining Naming and Directory Services</h4>
Directories often arrange their objects in a hierarchy.
For example, the LDAP arranges all directory objects in a tree,
called a <em>directory information tree (DIT)</em>.
Within the DIT, 
an organization object, for example, might contain
group objects that might in turn contain person objects.
When directory objects are arranged in this way,
they play the role of naming contexts
in addition to that of containers of attributes.
