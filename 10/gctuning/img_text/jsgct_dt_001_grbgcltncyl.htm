<p>This figure shows the sequence of G1 phases with the pauses that may occur during these phases. There are filled circles, every circle represents a garbage collection pause: blue circles represent young-only collection pauses, orange ones represent pauses induced by marking, and red circles represent mixed collection pauses. The pauses are threaded on two arrows forming a circle: one each for the pauses occurring during the young-only phase, another one representing the mixed collection phase. The young-only phase starts with a few young-only garbage collections represented by small blue circles. After object occupancy in the old generation reaches the threshold defined by <span class="apiname">InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent</span>, the next garbage collection pause will be an initial mark garbage collection pause, shown as larger blue circle. In addition to the same work as in other young-only pauses, it prepares concurrent marking.</p>
<p>While concurrent marking is running, other young-only pauses may occur, until the Remark pause (the first large orange circle), where G1 completes marking. Additional young-only garbage collections may occur until the Cleanup pause. After the Cleanup pause, there will be a final young-only garbage collection that finishes the young-only phase. During the space-reclamation phase a sequence of mixed collections will occur, indicated as red filled circles. Typically there are fewer mixed garbage collection pauses than young-only pauses in the young-only phase as G1 strives to make the space reclamations as efficient as possible.</p>
