<p>The figure consists of a 10-by-10 grid. Most of the grid's cells are gray. Nineteen cells are colored dark blue. These dark blue cells are randomly distributed in the upper six rows of the grid. Two of these dark blue cells contain a red box. A cell two cells wide and one cell high (which appears in the first row) and a cell three cells wide and one cell high (which appears in the sixth row) are colored dark blue and labeled "H." Eight cells are colored light blue and contain a red box. Two of these cells are labeled "S." These light blue cells with a red box are distributed randomly, most of them located in the upper half of the grid.</p>
