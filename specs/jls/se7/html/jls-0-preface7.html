         <p>The <span class="trademark">Java</span>&reg; SE 7 Edition of <em class="citetitle">The Java Language Specification</em> describes all the features
            that have been added to the Java programming language in Java SE 7. It also
            integrates changes made to the Java programming language under maintenance since the
            Third Edition in 2005.
         </p>
         <p>Readers may send feedback about errors and ambiguities in <em class="citetitle">The Java Language Specification</em>
            to <code class="literal">jls-comments_ww@oracle.com</code>.
         </p>
         <p>The majority of new features in this edition were specified by
            JSR 334, <em class="citetitle">Small Enhancements to the Java Programming
               Language</em>, led by Joe Darcy with an Expert Group of Joshua
            Bloch, Bruce Chapman, Alexey Kudravtsev, Mark Mahieu, Tim Peierls, and
            Olivier Thomann. The origins of these features lie
            in <em class="citetitle">Project Coin</em>, an OpenJDK project started in
            2009 with the goal of "Making things programmers do every day
            easier". The project solicited proposals from the Java community for
            broadly useful language features that were, in comparison with "large"
            features like generics, relatively "small" in their specification,
            implementation, and testing.
         </p>
         <p>Thousands of emails and six dozen proposals later, proposals
            were accepted from Joshua Bloch (the <code class="literal">try</code>-with-resources statement),
            Derek Foster/Bruce Chapman (improvements to literals), Neal Gafter
            (multi-<code class="literal">catch</code> and precise rethrow), Bob Lee (simplified variable
            arity method invocation), and Jeremy Manson (improved type inference
            for instance creation, a.k.a. the "diamond" syntax). The popular
            "strings in switch" feature was also accepted. Special thanks are due
            to Tom Ball, Stephen Colebourne, R&eacute;mi Forax, Shams Mahmood Imam, James
            Lowden, and all those who submitted interesting proposals and
            thoughtful comments to Project Coin. Over the course of the project,
            there were essential contributions from Mandy Chung, Jon Gibbons,
            Brian Goetz, David Holmes, and Dan Smith in areas ranging from library
            support to language specification. Stuart Marks led a "coinification"
            effort to apply the features to the Oracle JDK codebase, both to
            validate their utility and to develop conventions for wider
            use.
         </p>
         <p>The "diamond" syntax and precise rethrow give type inference a
            new visibility in the Java programming language. To a great extent, inference is
            worthwhile only if it produces types no less specific than those in a
            manifestly-typed program prior to Java SE 7. Otherwise, new code may
            find inference insufficient, and migration from manifest to inferred
            types in existing code will be risky. To mitigate the risk, Joe Darcy
            and Maurizio Cimadamore measured the effectiveness of different
            inference schemes on a large corpus of open source Java code. Such
            "quantitative language design" greatly improves confidence in the
            suitability and safety of the final feature. The challenge of growing
            a mature language with millions of developers is partially offset by
            the ability of language designers to learn from developers' actual
            code.
         </p>
         <p>The Java SE 7 platform adds features that cater for non-Java
            languages, effectively expanding the computational model of the
            platform. Without changes, the Java programming language would be unable to access or
            even express some of these features. Its static type system comes
            under particular stress when invoking code written in dynamically
            typed languages. Consequently, method invocation in the Java programming language has
            been modified to support method handle invocation as defined by JSR
            292, <em class="citetitle">Dynamically Typed Languages on the Java
               Platform</em>.
         </p>
         <p>The Java Compatibility Kit (JCK) team whose work helps validate
            this specification are due an enormous vote of thanks: Leonid
            Arbouzov, Alexey Gavrilov, Yulia Novozhilova, Sergey Reznick, and
            Victor Rudometov. Many other colleagues at Oracle (past or present)
            have also given valuable support to this specification: Uday
            Dhanikonda, Janet Koenig, Adam Messinger, Mark Reinhold, Georges Saab,
            Bill Shannon, and Bernard Traversat.
         </p>
         <p>The following individuals have all provided many valuable
            comments which improved this specification: J. Stephen Adamczyk, Peter
            Ah&eacute;, Davide Ancona, Michael Bailey, Dmitry Batrak, Joshua Bloch, Kevin
            Bourrillion, Richard Bosworth, Martin Bravenboer, Martin Buchholz,
            Didier Cruette, Glenn Colman, Neal Gafter, Jim Holmlund, Ric Holt,
            Philippe Mulet, Bill Pugh, Vladimir Reshetnikov, John Spicer, Robert
            Stroud, and Mattias Ulbrich.
         </p>
         <p>This edition is the first to be written in the DocBook XML
            format. Metadata in the XML markup forms a kind of static type system,
            classifying each paragraph by its role, such as a definition or an
            error. The reward is much crisper conformance testing. Many thanks go
            to Robert Stayton for sharing his considerable DocBook expertise and
            for helping to render DocBook in the traditional look and feel of
            <em class="citetitle">The Java Language Specification</em>.
