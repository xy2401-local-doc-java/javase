         <p>The Java SE 5.0 platform represents the largest set of changes
            in the history of the Java programming language. Generics, annotations, autoboxing
            and unboxing, enum types, foreach loops, variable arity methods, and
            static imports are all new to the language as of Autumn 2004.
         </p>
         <p>This Third Edition of <em class="citetitle">The Java Language Specification</em> reflects these developments. It
            integrates all the changes made to the Java programming language since the
            publication of the Second Edition in 2000, including asserts from J2SE
            1.4.
         </p>
         <p>The Java programming language has grown a great deal in these past four
            years. Unfortunately, it is unrealistic to shrink a commercially
            successful programming language - only to grow it more and more. The
            challenge of managing this growth under the constraints of
            compatibility and the conflicting demands of a wide variety of uses
            and users is non-trivial. I can only hope that we have met this
            challenge successfully with this specification; time will tell.
         </p>
         <p>This specification builds on the efforts of many people, both at
            Sun Microsystems and outside it.
         </p>
         <p>The most crucial contribution is that of the people who actually
            turn the specification into real software. Chief among these are the
            maintainers of <code class="literal">javac</code>, the reference compiler for
            the Java programming language.
         </p>
         <p>Neal Gafter was "Mr. <code class="literal">javac</code>" during the
            crucial period in which the large changes described here were
            integrated and productized. Neal's dedication and productivity can
            honestly be described as heroic. We literally could not have completed
            the task without him. In addition, his insight and skill made a huge
            contribution to the design of the new language features across the
            board. No one deserves more credit for this version of the Java programming language
            than he - but any blame for its deficiencies should be directed at
            myself and the members of the many JSR Expert Groups!
         </p>
         <p>Neal has gone on in search of new challenges, and has been
            succeeded by Peter von der Ah&eacute;, who continues to improve and stengthen
            the implementation. Before Neal's involvement, Bill Maddox was in
            charge of <code class="literal">javac</code> when the previous edition was
            completed, and he nursed features such as generics and asserts through
            their early days.
         </p>
         <p>Another individual who deserves to be singled out is Joshua
            Bloch. Josh participated in endless language design discussions,
            chaired several Expert Groups and was a key contributor to the Java
            platform. It is fair to say that Josh and Neal care more about this
            book than I do myself!
         </p>
         <p>Many parts of the specification were developed by various Expert
            Groups in the framework of the Java Community Process.
         </p>
         <p>The most pervasive set of language changes is the result of JSR
            14, <em class="citetitle">Adding Generics to the Java Programming
               Language</em>. The members of the JSR 14 Expert Group were
            Norman Cohen, Christian Kemper, Martin Odersky, Kresten Krab Thorup,
            Philip Wadler, and myself. In the early stages, Sven-Eric Panitz and
            Steve Marx were members as well. All deserve thanks for their
            participation.
         </p>
         <p>JSR 14 represents an unprecedented effort to fundamentally
            extend the type system of a widely used programming language under
            very stringent compatibility requirements. A prolonged and arduous
            process of design and implementation led us to the current language
            extension. Long before the JSR for generics was initiated, Martin
            Odersky and Philip Wadler had created an experimental language called
            Pizza to explore the ideas involved. In the spring of 1998, David
            Stoutamire and myself began a collaboration with Martin and Philip
            based on those ideas, that resulted in GJ. When the JSR 14 Expert
            Group was convened, GJ was chosen as the basis for extending the
            Java programming language. Martin Odersky implemented the GJ compiler, and his
            implementation became the basis for <code class="literal">javac</code> (starting
            with JDK 1.3, even though generics were disabled until 1.5).
         </p>
         <p>The theoretical basis for the core of the generic type system
            owes a great debt to the expertise of Martin Odersky and Philip
            Wadler. Later, the system was extended with wildcards. These were
            based on the work of Atsushi Igarashi and Mirko Viroli, which itself
            built on earlier work by Kresten Thorup and Mads Torgersen. Wildcards
            were initially designed and implemented as part of a collaboration
            between Sun and Aarhus University. Neal Gafter and myself participated
            on Sun's behalf, and Erik Ernst and Mads Torgersen, together with
            Peter von der Ah&eacute; and Christian Plesner-Hansen, represented
            Aarhus. Thanks to Ole Lehrmann-Madsen for enabling and supporting that
            work.
         </p>
         <p>Joe Darcy and Ken Russell implemented much of the specific
            support for reflection of generics. Neal Gafter, Josh Bloch and Mark
            Reinhold did a huge amount of work generifying the JDK
            libraries.
         </p>
         <p>Honorable mention must go to individuals whose comments on the
            generics design made a significant difference. Alan Jeffrey made
            crucial contributions to JSR 14 by pointing out subtle flaws in the
            original type system. Bob Deen suggested the "? super T" syntax for
            lower bounded wildcards.
         </p>
         <p>JSR 201 included a series of changes: autoboxing, enums, foreach
            loops, variable arity methods and static import. The members of the
            JSR 201 Expert Group were C&eacute;dric Beust, David Biesack, Joshua Bloch
            (co-chair), Corky Cartwright, Jim des Rivieres, David Flanagan,
            Christian Kemper, Doug Lea, Changshin Lee, Tim Peierls, Michel
            Trudeau, and myself (co-chair). Enums and the foreach loop were
            primarily designed by Josh Bloch and Neal Gafter. Variable arity
            methods would never have made it into the Java programming language without Neal's
            special efforts designing them (not to mention the small matter of
            implementing them).
         </p>
         <p>Josh Bloch bravely took upon himself the responsibility for JSR
            175, which added annotations to the Java programming language. The members of JSR 175
            Expert Group were C&eacute;dric Beust, Joshua Bloch (chair), Ted Farrell,
            Mike French, Gregor Kiczales, Doug Lea, Deeptendu Majunder, Simon
            Nash, Ted Neward, Roly Perera, Manfred Schneider, Blake Stone, and
            Josh Street. Neal Gafter, as usual, was a major contributor on this
            front as well.
         </p>
         <p>Another change in this edition is a complete revision of the
            Java memory model, undertaken by JSR 133. The members of the JSR 133
            Expert Group were Hans Boehm, Doug Lea, Tim Lindholm (co-chair), Bill
            Pugh (co-chair), Martin Trotter, and Jerry Schwarz. The primary
            technical authors of the memory model are Sarita Adve, Jeremy Manson,
            and Bill Pugh. The Java memory model chapter in this book is in fact
            almost entirely their work, with only editorial revisions. Joseph
            Bowbeer, David Holmes, Victor Luchangco, and Jan-Willem Maessen made
            significant contributions as well. Key sections dealing with
            finalization in Chapter 12 owe much to this work as well, and
            especially to Doug Lea.
         </p>
         <p>Many people have provided valuable comments on this
            edition.
         </p>
         <p>I'd like to express my gratitude to Archibald Putt, who provided
            insight and encouragement. His writings are always an
            inspiration. Thanks once again to Joe Darcy for introducing us, as
            well as for many useful comments, and his specific contributions on
            numerical issues and the design of hexadecimal literals.
         </p>
         <p>Many colleagues at Sun (past or present) have provided useful
            feedback and discussion, and helped produce this work in myriad ways:
            Andrew Bennett, Martin Buchholz, Jerry Driscoll, Robert Field,
            Jonathan Gibbons, Graham Hamilton, Mimi Hills, Jim Holmlund, Janet
            Koenig, Jeff Norton, Scott Seligman, Wei Tao, and David Ungar. 
         </p>
         <p>Special thanks to Laurie Tolson, my manager, for her support
            throughout the long process of deriving these specifications.
         </p>

            Bravenboer, Bruce Chapman, Lawrence Gonsalves, Tim Hanson, David
            Holmes, Angelika Langer, Pat Lavarre, Philippe Mulet, and Cal
            Varnson.
         </p>
         <p>Ann Sellers, Greg Doench, and John Fuller at Addison-Wesley were
            exceedingly patient and ensured that the book materialized, despite
            the many missed deadlines for this text.
         </p>
         <p>As always, I thank my wife Weihong and my son Teva for their
            support and cooperation.
