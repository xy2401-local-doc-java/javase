         <p>Over the past few years, the Java programming language has enjoyed
            unprecedented success. This success has brought a challenge: along
            with explosive growth in popularity, there has been explosive growth
            in the demands made on the language and its libraries. To meet this
            challenge, the language has grown as well (fortunately, not
            explosively) and so have the libraries.
         </p>
         <p>This Second Edition of <em class="citetitle">The Java Language Specification</em> reflects these developments. It
            integrates all the changes made to the Java programming language since the
            publication of the First Edition in 1996. The bulk of these changes
            were made in the 1.1 release of the Java platform in 1997, and revolve
            around the addition of nested type declarations. Later modifications
            pertained to floating-point operations. In addition, this edition
            incorporates important clarifications and amendments involving method
            lookup and binary compatibility.
         </p>
         <p>This specification defines the language as it exists today. The
            Java programming language is likely to continue to evolve. At this writing, there are
            ongoing initiatives through the Java Community Process to extend the
            language with generic types and assertions, refine the memory model,
            etc. However, it would be inappropriate to delay the publication of
            the Second Edition until these efforts are concluded.
         </p>
         <p>The specifications of the libraries are now far too large to fit
            into this volume, and they continue to evolve. Consequently, API
            specifications have been removed from this book. The library
            specifications can be found on the Web;  this specification now concentrates solely on the Java programming language
            proper.
         </p>
         <p>Many people contributed to this book, directly and
            indirectly. Tim Lindholm brought extraordinary dedication to his role
            as technical editor of the Java Series. He also made invaluable
            technical contributions, especially on floating-point issues. The book
            would likely not see the light of day without him. Lisa Friendly, the
            Series editor, provided encouragement and advice for which I am very
            thankful.
         </p>
         <p>David Bowen first suggested that I get involved in the
            specifications of the Java platform. I am grateful to him for
            introducing me to this uncommonly rich area.
         </p>
         <p>John Rose, the father of nested types in the Java programming language, has
            been unfailingly gracious and supportive of my attempts to specify
            them accurately.
         </p>
         <p>Many people have provided valuable comments on this
            edition. Special thanks go to Roly Perera at Ergnosis and to Leonid
            Arbouzov and his colleagues on the Java platform
            conformance team in Novosibirsk: Konstantin Bobrovsky, Natalia
            Golovleva, Vladimir Ivanov, Alexei Kaigorodov, Serguei Katkov, Dmitri
            Khukhro, Eugene Latkin, Ilya Neverov, Pavel Ozhdikhin, Igor Pyankov,
            Viatcheslav Rybalov, Serguei Samoilidi, Maxim Sokolnikov, and Vitaly
            Tchaiko. Their thorough reading of earlier drafts has greatly improved
            the accuracy of this specification.
         </p>
         <p>I am indebted to Martin Odersky and to Andrew Bennett and the
            members of the <code class="literal">javac</code> compiler team,
            past and present: Iris Garcia, Bill Maddox, David Stoutamire, and Todd
            Turnidge. They all worked hard to make sure the reference
            implementation conformed to the specification. For many enjoyable
            technical exchanges, I thank them and my other colleagues at Sun: Lars
            Bak, Joshua Bloch, Cliff Click, Robert Field, Mohammad Gharahgouzloo,
            Ben Gomes, Steffen Grarup, Robert Griesemer, Graham Hamilton, Gordon
            Hirsch, Peter Kessler, Sheng Liang, James McIlree, Philip Milne,
            Srdjan Mitrovic, Anand Palaniswamy, Mike Paleczny, Mark Reinhold,
            Kenneth Russell, Rene Schmidt, David Ungar, Chris Vick, and Hong
            Zhang.
         </p>
         <p>Tricia Jordan, my manager, has been a model of patience,
            consideration and understanding. Thanks are also due to Larry
            Abrahams, director of Java 2 Standard Edition, for supporting this
            work.
         </p>
         <p>The following individuals all provided useful comments that have
            contributed to this specification: Godmar Bak, Hans Boehm, Philippe
            Charles, David Chase, Joe Darcy, Jim des Rivieres, Sophia
            Drossopoulou, Susan Eisenbach, Paul Haahr, Urs Hoelzle, Bart Jacobs,

            Shepherd, David Shields, John Spicer, Lee Worall, and David
            Wragg.
         </p>
         <p>Suzette Pelouch provided invaluable assistance with the index
            and, together with Doug Kramer and Atul Dambalkar, assisted with
            FrameMaker expertise; Mike Hendrickson and Julie Dinicola at
            Addison-Wesley were gracious, helpful and ultimately made this book a
            reality.
         </p>
         <p>On a personal note, I thank my wife Weihong for her love and
            support.
         </p>
         <p>Finally, I'd like to thank my coauthors, James Gosling, Bill
            Joy, and Guy Steele for inviting me to participate in this work. It
            has been a pleasure and a privilege.
