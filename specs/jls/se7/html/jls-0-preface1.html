         <p>The Java programming language was originally called Oak, and was designed for
            use in embedded consumer-electronic applications by James
            Gosling. After several years of experience with the language, and
            significant contributions by Ed Frank, Patrick Naughton, Jonathan
            Payne, and Chris Warth it was retargeted to the Internet, renamed, and
            substantially revised to be the language specified here. The final
            form of the language was defined by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy
            Steele, Richard Tuck, Frank Yellin, and Arthur van Hoff, with help
            from Graham Hamilton, Tim Lindholm, and many other friends and
            colleagues.
         </p>
         <p>The Java programming language is a general-purpose concurrent class-based
            object-oriented programming language, specifically designed to have as
            few implementation dependencies as possible. It allows application
            developers to write a program once and then be able to run it
            everywhere on the Internet.
         </p>
         <p>This book attempts a complete specification of the syntax and
            semantics of the language. We intend that the behavior of every
            language construct is specified here, so that all implementations will
            accept the same programs. Except for timing dependencies or other
            non-determinisms and given sufficient time and sufficient memory
            space, a program written in the Java programming language should compute the same
            result on all machines and in all implementations.
         </p>
         <p>We believe that the Java programming language is a mature language, ready for
            widespread use. Nevertheless, we expect some evolution of the language
            in the years to come. We intend to manage this evolution in a way that
            is completely compatible with existing applications. To do this, we
            intend to make relatively few new versions of the language. Compilers
            and systems will be able to support the several versions
            simultaneously, with complete compatibility.
         </p>
         <p>Much research and experimentation with the Java platform is
            already underway. We encourage this work, and will continue to
            cooperate with external groups to explore improvements to the language
            and platform. For example, we have already received several
            interesting proposals for parameterized types. In technically
            difficult areas, near the state of the art, this kind of research
            collaboration is essential.
         </p>
         <p>We acknowledge and thank the many people who have contributed to
            this book through their excellent feedback, assistance and
            encouragement:
         </p>
         <p>Particularly thorough, careful, and thoughtful reviews of drafts
            were provided by Tom Cargill, Peter Deutsch, Paul Hilfinger, Masayuki
            Ida, David Moon, Steven Muchnick, Charles L. Perkins, Chris Van Wyk,
            Steve Vinoski, Philip Wadler, Daniel Weinreb, and Kenneth Zadeck. We
            are very grateful for their extraordinary volunteer efforts.
         </p>
         <p>We are also grateful for reviews, questions, comments, and
            suggestions from Stephen Adams, Bowen Alpern, Glenn Ammons, Leonid
            Arbouzov, Kim Bruce, Edwin Chan, David Chase, Pavel Curtis, Drew Dean,
            William Dietz, David Dill, Patrick Dussud, Ed Felten, John
            Giannandrea, John Gilmore, Charles Gust, Warren Harris, Lee Hasiuk,
            Mike Hendrickson, Mark Hill, Urs Hoelzle, Roger Hoover, Susan Flynn
            Hummel, Christopher Jang, Mick Jordan, Mukesh Kacker, Peter Kessler,
            James Larus, Derek Lieber, Bill McKeeman, Steve Naroff, Evi Nemeth,
            Robert O'Callahan, Dave Papay, Craig Partridge, Scott Pfeffer, Eric
            Raymond, Jim Roskind, Jim Russell, William Scherlis, Edith Schonberg,
            Anthony Scian, Matthew Self, Janice Shepherd, Kathy Stark, Barbara
            Steele, Rob Strom, William Waite, Greg Weeks, and Bob Wilson. (This
            list was generated semi-automatically from our E-mail records. We
            apologize if we have omitted anyone.)
         </p>
         <p>The feedback from all these reviewers was invaluable to us in
            improving the definition of the language as well as the form of the
            presentation in this book. We thank them for their diligence. Any
            remaining errors in this book - we hope they are few - are our
            responsibility and not theirs.
         </p>
         <p>We thank Francesca Freedman and Doug Kramer for assistance with
            matters of typography and layout. We thank Dan Mills of Adobe Systems
            Incorporated for assistance in exploring possible choices of
            typefaces.
         </p>
         <p>Many of our colleagues at Sun Microsystems have helped us in one
            way or another. Lisa Friendly, our series editor, managed our
            relationship with Addison-Wesley. Susan Stambaugh managed the
            distribution of many hundreds of copies of drafts to reviewers. We
            received valuable assistance and technical advice from Ben Adida, Ole
            Agesen, Ken Arnold, Rick Cattell, Asmus Freytag, Norm Hardy, Steve
            Heller, David Hough, Doug Kramer, Nancy Lee, Marianne Mueller, Akira
            Tanaka, Greg Tarsy, David Ungar, Jim Waldo, Ann Wollrath, Geoff Wyant,
            and Derek White. We thank Alan Baratz, David Bowen, Mike Clary, John
            Doerr, Jon Kannegaard, Eric Schmidt, Bob Sproull, Bert Sutherland, and
            Scott McNealy for leadership and encouragement.
         </p>
         <p>We are thankful for the tools and services we had at our
            disposal in writing this book: telephones, overnight delivery, desktop
            workstations, laser printers, photocopiers, text formatting and page
            layout software, fonts, electronic mail, the World Wide Web, and, of
            course, the Internet. We live in three different states, scattered
            across a continent, but collaboration with each other and with our
            reviewers has seemed almost effortless. Kudos to the thousands of
            people who have worked over the years to make these excellent tools
            and services work quickly and reliably.
         </p>
         <p>Mike Hendrickson, Katie Duffy, Simone Payment, and Rosa Aim&eacute;e
            Gonz&aacute;lez of Addison-Wesley were very helpful, encouraging, and patient
            during the long process of bringing this book to print. We also thank
            the copy editors.
         </p>
         <p>Rosemary Simpson worked hard, on a very tight schedule, to
            create the index. We got into the act at the last minute, however;
            blame us and not her for any jokes you may find hidden therein.
         </p>
         <p>Finally, we are grateful to our families and friends for their
            love and support during this last, crazy, year.
         </p>
         <p>In their book <em class="citetitle">The C Programming Language</em>,
            Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie said that they felt that the C
            language "wears well as one's experience with it grows." If you like
            C, we think you will like the Java programming language. We hope that it, too, wears
            well for you.
