         <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1-100"></a>The <span class="trademark">Java</span>&reg; programming language is a
            general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language. It
            is designed to be simple enough that many programmers can achieve
            fluency in the language. The Java programming language is related to C and C++ but is
            organized rather differently, with a number of aspects of C and C++
            omitted and a few ideas from other languages included. It is intended
            to be a production language, not a research language, and so, as
            C. A. R. Hoare suggested in his classic paper on language design, the
            design has avoided including new and untested features.
         </p>
         <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1-110"></a>The Java programming language is
            strongly and statically typed. This specification
            clearly distinguishes between the <span class="emphasis"><em>compile-time
                  errors</em></span> that can and must be detected at compile time, and
            those that occur at run time. Compile time normally consists of
            translating programs into a machine-independent byte code
            representation. Run-time activities include loading and linking of the
            classes needed to execute a program, optional machine code generation
            and dynamic optimization of the program, and actual program
            execution.
         </p>
         <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1-120"></a>The Java programming language is a relatively
            high-level language, in that details of the machine representation are
            not available through the language. It includes automatic storage
            management, typically using a garbage collector, to avoid the safety
            problems of explicit deallocation (as in C's <code class="literal">free</code>
            or C++'s <code class="literal">delete</code>). High-performance
            garbage-collected implementations can have bounded pauses to support
            systems programming and real-time applications. The language does not
            include any unsafe constructs, such as array accesses without index
            checking, since such unsafe constructs would cause a program to behave
            in an unspecified way.
         </p>
         <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1-130"></a>The Java programming language is normally
            compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format defined in
            <em class="citetitle">The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Java SE 9 Edition</em>.

            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-100"></a>Chapter 2 describes grammars
               and the notation used to present the lexical and syntactic grammars
               for the language.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-110"></a>Chapter 3 describes the lexical
               structure of the Java programming language, which is based on C and C++. The language
               is written in the Unicode character set. It supports the writing of
               Unicode characters on systems that support only ASCII.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-120"></a>Chapter 4 describes types,
               values, and variables. Types are subdivided into primitive types and
               reference types.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-130"></a>The primitive types are defined
               to be the same on all machines and in all implementations, and are
               various sizes of two's-complement integers, single- and
               double-precision IEEE 754 standard floating-point numbers, a <code class="literal">boolean</code>
               type, and a Unicode character <code class="literal">char</code> type. Values of the primitive
               types do not share state.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-140"></a>Reference types are the class
               types, the interface types, and the array types. The reference types
               are implemented by dynamically created objects that are either
               instances of classes or arrays. Many references to each object can
               exist. All objects (including arrays) support the methods of the class
               <code class="literal">Object</code>, which is the (single) root of the class hierarchy. A
               predefined <code class="literal">String</code> class supports Unicode character strings. Classes
               exist for wrapping primitive values inside of objects. In many cases,
               wrapping and unwrapping is performed automatically by the compiler (in
               which case, wrapping is called boxing, and unwrapping is called
               unboxing). Class and interface declarations may be generic, that is,
               they may be parameterized by other reference types. Such declarations
               may then be invoked with specific type arguments.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-150"></a>Variables are typed storage
               locations. A variable of a primitive type holds a value of that exact
               primitive type. A variable of a class type can hold a null reference
               or a reference to an object whose type is that class type or any
               subclass of that class type. A variable of an interface type can hold
               a null reference or a reference to an instance of any class that
               implements the interface. A variable of an array type can hold a null
               reference or a reference to an array. A variable of class type
               <code class="literal">Object</code> can hold a null reference or a reference to any object,
               whether class instance or array.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-160"></a>Chapter 5 describes conversions
               and numeric promotions. Conversions change the compile-time type and,
               sometimes, the value of an expression. These conversions include the
               boxing and unboxing conversions between primitive types and reference
               types. Numeric promotions are used to convert the operands of a
               numeric operator to a common type where an operation can be
               performed. There are no loopholes in the language; casts on reference
               types are checked at run time to ensure type safety.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-170"></a>
               Chapter 6 describes declarations and names, and how to determine what
               names mean (that is, which declaration a name denotes). The Java programming language
               does not require classes and interfaces, or their members, to be
               declared before they are used. Declaration order is significant only
               for local variables, local classes, and the order of field
               initializers in a class or interface. Recommended naming conventions
               that make for more readable programs are described here.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-180"></a>
               Chapter 7 describes the structure of a program, which is organized
               into packages. The members of a package are classes, interfaces, and
               subpackages. Packages, and consequently their members, have names in a
               hierarchical name space; the Internet domain name system can usually
               be used to form unique package names. Compilation units contain
               declarations of the classes and interfaces that are members of a given
               package, and may import classes and interfaces from other packages to
               give them short names.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-190"></a>
               Packages may be grouped into modules that serve as building blocks in
               the construction of very large programs. The declaration of a module
               specifies which other modules (and thus packages, and thus classes and
               interfaces) are required in order to compile and run code in its own
               packages.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-191"></a>
               The Java programming language supports limitations on external access to the members
               of packages, classes, and interfaces. The members of a package may be
               accessible solely by other members in the same package, or by members
               in other packages of the same module, or by members of packages in
               different modules. Similar constraints apply to the members of classes
               and interfaces.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-200"></a>Chapter 8 describes
               classes. The members of classes are classes, interfaces, fields
               (variables) and methods. Class variables exist once per class. Class
               methods operate without reference to a specific object. Instance
               variables are dynamically created in objects that are instances of
               classes. Instance methods are invoked on instances of classes; such
               instances become the current object <code class="literal">this</code> during their execution,
               supporting the object-oriented programming style.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-210"></a>
               Classes support single  inheritance, in
               which  each
               class has a single superclass. Each class inherits members from its
               superclass, and ultimately from the class <code class="literal">Object</code>. Variables of a
               class type can reference an instance of that class or of any subclass
               of that class, allowing new types to be used with existing methods,
               polymorphically.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-220"></a>Classes support concurrent
               programming with <code class="literal">synchronized</code> methods. Methods declare the checked
               exceptions that can arise from their execution, which allows
               compile-time checking to ensure that exceptional conditions are
               handled. Objects can declare a <code class="literal">finalize</code> method that
               will be invoked before the objects are discarded by the garbage
               collector, allowing the objects to clean up their state.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-230"></a>For simplicity, the language
               has neither declaration "headers" separate from the implementation of
               a class nor separate type and class hierarchies.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-240"></a>A special form of classes,
               enums, support the definition of small sets of values and their
               manipulation in a type safe manner. Unlike enumerations in other
               languages, enums are objects and may have their own methods.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-250"></a>
               Chapter 9 describes interfaces. The members of interfaces are classes,
               interfaces, constant fields, and methods. Classes that are otherwise
               unrelated can implement the same interface. A variable of an interface
               type can contain a reference to any object that implements the
               interface. 
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-251"></a>
               Classes and interfaces support multiple inheritance from interfaces. A
               class that implements one or more interfaces may inherit instance
               methods from both its superclass and its superinterfaces.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-260"></a>Annotation types are
               specialized interfaces used to annotate declarations. Such annotations
               are not permitted to affect the semantics of programs in the
               Java programming language in any way. However, they provide useful input to various
               tools.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-270"></a>Chapter 10 describes
               arrays. Array accesses include bounds checking. Arrays are dynamically
               created objects and may be assigned to variables of type <code class="literal">Object</code>. The
               language supports arrays of arrays, rather than multidimensional
               arrays.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-280"></a>Chapter 11 describes
               exceptions, which are nonresuming and fully integrated with the
               language semantics and concurrency mechanisms. There are three kinds
               of exceptions: checked exceptions, run-time exceptions, and
               errors. The compiler ensures that checked exceptions are properly
               handled by requiring that a method or constructor can result in a
               checked exception only if the method or constructor declares it. This
               provides compile-time checking that exception handlers exist, and aids
               programming in the large. Most user-defined exceptions should be
               checked exceptions. Invalid operations in the program detected by the
               Java Virtual Machine result in run-time exceptions, such as <code class="literal">NullPointerException</code>. Errors result from
               failures detected by the Java Virtual Machine, such as <code class="literal">OutOfMemoryError</code>. Most simple programs
               do not try to handle errors.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-290"></a>Chapter 12 describes activities
               that occur during execution of a program. A program is normally stored
               as binary files representing compiled classes and interfaces. These
               binary files can be loaded into a Java Virtual Machine, linked to other classes and
               interfaces, and initialized.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-300"></a>After initialization, class
               methods and class variables may be used. Some classes may be
               instantiated to create new objects of the class type. Objects that are
               class instances also contain an instance of each superclass of the
               class, and object creation involves recursive creation of these
               superclass instances.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-310"></a>When an object is no longer
               referenced, it may be reclaimed by the garbage collector. If an object
               declares a finalizer, the finalizer is executed before the object is
               reclaimed to give the object a last chance to clean up resources that
               would not otherwise be released. When a class is no longer needed, it
               may be unloaded.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-320"></a>Chapter 13 describes binary
               compatibility, specifying the impact of changes to types on other
               types that use the changed types but have not been recompiled. These
               considerations are of interest to developers of types that are to be
               widely distributed, in a continuing series of versions, often through
               the Internet. Good program development environments automatically
               recompile dependent code whenever a type is changed, so most
               programmers need not be concerned about these details.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.1-330"></a>Chapter 14 describes blocks and
               statements, which are based on C and C++. The language has
               no <code class="literal">goto</code> statement, but includes labeled <code class="literal">break</code> and
               <code class="literal">continue</code> statements. Unlike C, the Java programming language requires <code class="literal">boolean</code> (or
               <code class="literal">Boolean</code>) expressions in control-flow statements, and does not
               convert types to <code class="literal">boolean</code> implicitly (except through unboxing), in
               the hope of catching more errors at compile time. A <code class="literal">synchronized</code>
               statement provides basic object-level monitor locking. A <code class="literal">try</code>
               statement can include <code class="literal">catch</code> and <code class="literal">finally</code> clauses to protect against
               non-local control transfers.

               evaluation of expressions, for increased determinism and

               compile time by picking the most specific method or constructor from

               initialize local variables in order to avoid masking programming

            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.4-100"></a>As noted above, this
               specification often refers to classes of the Java SE Platform API. In
               particular, some classes have a special relationship with the
               Java programming language. Examples include classes such as <code class="literal">Object</code>, <code class="literal">Class</code>,
               <code class="literal">ClassLoader</code>, <code class="literal">String</code>, <code class="literal">Thread</code>, and the classes and interfaces in
               package <code class="literal">java.lang.reflect</code>, among others. This specification constrains
               the behavior of such classes and interfaces, but does not provide a
               complete specification for them. The reader is referred to the
               Java SE Platform API documentation.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jls-1.4-110"></a>Consequently, this
               specification does not describe reflection in any detail. Many
               linguistic constructs have analogs in the Core Reflection API
               (<code class="literal">java.lang.reflect</code>) and the Language Model API
               (<code class="literal">javax.lang.model</code>), but these are generally not
               discussed here. For example, when we list the ways in which an object
               can be created, we generally do not include the ways in which the Core
               Reflection API can accomplish this. Readers should be aware of these
               additional mechanisms even though they are not mentioned in the
               text.
