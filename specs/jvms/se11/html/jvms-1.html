            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.1-100"></a>The <span class="trademark">Java</span>&reg; programming language is a
               general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented language. Its syntax is
               similar to C and C++, but it omits many of the features that make C
               and C++ complex, confusing, and unsafe. The Java platform was
               initially developed to address the problems of building software for
               networked consumer devices. It was designed to support multiple host
               architectures and to allow secure delivery of software components. To
               meet these requirements, compiled code had to survive transport across
               networks, operate on any client, and assure the client that it was
               safe to run.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.1-110"></a>The popularization of the
               World Wide Web made these attributes much more interesting. Web
               browsers enabled millions of people to surf the Net and access
               media-rich content in simple ways. At last there was a medium where
               what you saw and heard was essentially the same regardless of the
               machine you were using and whether it was connected to a fast network
               or a slow modem.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.1-120"></a>Web enthusiasts soon
               discovered that the content supported by the Web's HTML document
               format was too limited. HTML extensions, such as forms, only
               highlighted those limitations, while making it clear that no browser
               could include all the features users wanted. Extensibility was the
               answer.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.1-130"></a>The HotJava
               browser first showcased the interesting properties of the Java programming language
               and platform by making it possible to embed programs inside HTML
               pages. Programs are transparently downloaded into the browser along
               with the HTML pages in which they appear. Before being accepted by the
               browser, programs are carefully checked to make sure they are
               safe. Like HTML pages, compiled programs are network- and
               host-independent. The programs behave the same way regardless of where
               they come from or what kind of machine they are being loaded into and
               run on.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.1-140"></a>A Web browser incorporating
               the Java platform is no longer limited to a predetermined set of
               capabilities. Visitors to Web pages incorporating dynamic content can
               be assured that their machines cannot be damaged by that
               content. Programmers can write a program once, and it will run on any
               machine supplying a Java run-time environment.

            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.2-100"></a>The Java Virtual Machine is the cornerstone
               of the Java platform. It is the component of the technology
               responsible for its hardware- and operating system-independence, the
               small size of its compiled code, and its ability to protect users from
               malicious programs.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.2-110"></a>The Java Virtual Machine is an abstract
               computing machine. Like a real computing machine, it has an
               instruction set and manipulates various memory areas at run time. It
               is reasonably common to implement a programming language using a
               virtual machine; the best-known virtual machine may be the P-Code
               machine of UCSD Pascal.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.2-120"></a>The first prototype
               implementation of the Java Virtual Machine, done at Sun Microsystems, Inc., emulated
               the Java Virtual Machine instruction set in software hosted by a handheld device that
               resembled a contemporary Personal Digital Assistant (PDA). Oracle's
               current implementations emulate the Java Virtual Machine on mobile, desktop and
               server devices, but the Java Virtual Machine does not assume any particular
               implementation technology, host hardware, or host operating system. It
               is not inherently interpreted, but can just as well be implemented by
               compiling its instruction set to that of a silicon CPU. It may also be
               implemented in microcode or directly in silicon.
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.2-130"></a>The Java Virtual Machine knows nothing of the
               Java programming language, only of a particular binary format, the <code class="literal">class</code> file
               format. A <code class="literal">class</code> file contains Java Virtual Machine instructions
               (or <span class="emphasis"><em>bytecodes</em></span>) and a symbol table, as well as
               other ancillary information. 
            </p>
            <p class="norm"><a name="jvms-1.2-140"></a>For the sake of security, the
               Java Virtual Machine imposes strong syntactic and structural constraints on the code
               in a <code class="literal">class</code> file. However, any language with functionality that can
               be expressed in terms of a valid <code class="literal">class</code> file can be hosted by the
               Java Virtual Machine. Attracted by a generally available, machine-independent
               platform, implementors of other languages can turn to the Java Virtual Machine as a
               delivery vehicle for their languages.
            </p>
            <p>The Java Virtual Machine specified here is compatible with the Java SE 11
