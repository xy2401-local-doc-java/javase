         <p>The <span class="trademark">Java</span>&reg; SE 7 Edition of <em class="citetitle">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em> incorporates all the changes
            that have been made to the Java Virtual Machine since the Second Edition in 1999. In
            addition, numerous corrections and clarifications have been made to
            align with popular implementations of the Java Virtual Machine, and with concepts
            common to the Java Virtual Machine and the Java programming language.
         </p>
         <p>Readers may send feedback about errors and ambiguities in <em class="citetitle">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em>
            to <code class="literal">jvms-comments_ww@oracle.com</code>.
         </p>
         <p>The Java SE 5.0 platform in 2004 brought momentous changes to
            the Java programming language but had a relatively muted effect on the design of the
            Java Virtual Machine. Additions were made to the <code class="literal">class</code> file format to support new
            Java programming language features such as generics and variable arity
            methods.
         </p>
         <p>The Java SE 6 platform in 2006 saw no changes to the Java programming language
            but an entirely new approach to bytecode verification in the
            Java Virtual Machine. Eva Rose, in her Master's Thesis, proposed a radical revision
            of bytecode verification in the context of the Java Card
            platform. This led to an implementation for Java ME CLDC, and
            eventually to the revision of the Java SE verification process
            documented in Chapter 4.
         </p>
         <p>Sheng Liang implemented the Java ME CLDC verifier. Antero
            Taivalsaari led the overall specification of Java ME CLDC and Gilad
            Bracha was responsible for specifying the verifier. Alessandro
            Coglio's analysis of bytecode verification was the most extensive,
            realistic, and thorough study of the topic, and contributed greatly to
            the specification. Wei Tao, together with Frank Yellin, Tim Lindholm,
            and Gilad Bracha, implemented the Prolog verifier that formed the
            basis for the specification in both Java ME and Java SE. Wei then
            implemented the specification "for real" in the HotSpot JVM. Later,
            Mingyao Yang improved the design and specification, and implemented
            the final version that shipped in the Reference Implementation of Java
            SE 6. The specification also benefited from the efforts of the JSR 202
            Expert Group: Peter Burka, Alessandro Coglio, Sanghoon Jin, Christian
            Kemper, Larry Rau, Eva Rose, and Mark Stolz.
         </p>
         <p>The Java SE 7 platform in 2011 made good on the promise given in
            the First Edition of <em class="citetitle">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</em> in 1997: "In the future, we will consider
            bounded extensions to the Java virtual machine to provide better
            support for other languages." Gilad Bracha, in his work on
            hotswapping, anticipated the burden of the Java Virtual Machine's static type system
            on implementers of dynamically-typed languages. Consequently, the
            <span class="emphasis"><em>invokedynamic</em></span> instruction and its supporting infrastructure were
            developed by John Rose and the JSR 292 Expert Group: Ola Bini, R&eacute;mi
            Forax, Dan Heidinga, Fredrik &Ouml;hrstr&ouml;m, and Jochen Theodorou, with
            special contributions from Charlie Nutter and Christian
            Thalinger.
         </p>
         <p>More people than we can mention here have, over time,
            contributed to the design and implementation of the Java Virtual Machine. The
            excellent performance we see in the Java Virtual Machine implementations of today
            would never have been possible without the technological foundation
            laid by David Ungar and his colleagues at the Self project at Sun
            Labs. This technology took a convoluted path, from Self on through the
            Animorphic Smalltalk VM to eventually become the HotSpot JVM. Lars Bak
            and Urs H&ouml;lzle are the two people who were present through all these
            stages, and are more responsible than anyone else for the high
            performance we take for granted in Java Virtual Machine implementations today.
         </p>
         <p>This specification has been significantly improved thanks to
            contributions from Martin Buchholz, Brian Goetz, Paul Hohensee, David
            Holmes, Karen Kinnear, Keith McGuigan, Jeff Nisewanger, Mark Reinhold,
            Naoto Sato, and Bill Pugh, as well as Uday Dhanikonda, Janet Koenig,
            Adam Messinger, John Pampuch, Georges Saab, and Bernard Traversat. Jon
            Courtney and Roger Riggs helped to ensure this specification is
            applicable to Java ME as much as Java SE. Leonid Arbouzov, Stanislav
            Avzan, Yuri Gaevsky, Ilya Mukhin, Sergey Reznick, and Kirill Shirokov
            have done outstanding work in the Java Compatibility Kit to ensure
            this specification is both testable and tested.
