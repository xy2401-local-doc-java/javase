<h2><a name="19853"><i>2</i> New Protection Mechanisms -- Overview
of Basic Concepts</a></h2>
<a name="19854"><!-- --></a> We now go over, in some detail, the
new protection architecture and give a brief explanation of its
functionality. We start with an overview of the basic concepts
behind the new architecture. We then introduce the major new
classes in a natural order, starting with permission
specifications, going on to the policy and related features,
followed by access control and its usage, and then covering secure
class loading and resolution.
<p><a name="16572"><!-- --></a> A fundamental concept and important
building block of system security is the protection domain [Saltzer
and Schroeder 75]. A domain can be scoped by the set of objects
that are currently directly accessible by a principal, where a
principal is an entity in the computer system to which permissions
(and as a result, accountability) are granted. The sandbox utilized
in JDK 1.0 is one example of a protection domain with a fixed
boundary.</p>
<p><a name="16596"><!-- --></a> The protection domain concept
serves as a convenient mechanism for grouping and isolation between
units of protection. For example, it is possible (but not yet
provided as a built-in feature) to separate protection domains from
interacting with each other so that any permitted interaction must
be either through trusted system code or explicitly allowed by the
domains concerned. Note that existing object accessibility rules
remain valid under the new security architecture.</p>
<p><a name="16647"><!-- --></a> Protection domains generally fall
into two distinct categories: system domain and application domain.
It is important that all protected external resources, such as the
file system, the networking facility, and the screen and keyboard,
be accessible only via system domains. The figure below illustrates
the domain composition of a Java application environment.</p>
<p><a name="17945"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="See long description" longdesc=
"security-spec2.txt" src="security-spec.doc.anc2.gif" />
<a href="security-spec2.txt" title="Long description for">[D]</a>
<p><a name="29031"><!-- --></a> A domain conceptually encloses a
set of classes whose instances are granted the same set of
permissions. Protection domains are determined by the policy
currently in effect. The Java application environment maintains a
mapping from code (classes and instances) to their protection
domains and then to their permissions, as illustrated by the figure
below.</p>
<p><a name="21570"><!-- --></a></p>
<img alt="See long description" longdesc=
"security-spec3.txt" src="security-spec.doc.anc.gif" />
<a href="security-spec3.txt" title="Long description for">[D]</a>
<p><a name="21576"><!-- --></a></p>
<p><a name="19728"><!-- --></a> A thread of execution (which is
often, but not necessarily tied to, a single Java thread, which in
turn is not necessarily tied to the thread concept of the
underlying operation system) may occur completely within a single
protection domain or may involve an application domain and also the
system domain. For example, an application that prints a message
out will have to interact with the system domain that is the only
access point to an output stream. In this case, it is crucial that
at any time the application domain does not gain additional
permissions by calling the system domain. Otherwise, there can be
serious security implications.</p>
<p><a name="16749"><!-- --></a> In the reverse situation where a
system domain invokes a method from an application domain, such as
when the AWT system domain calls an applet&#39;s paint method to
display the applet, it is again crucial that at any time the
effective access rights are the same as current rights enabled in
the application domain.</p>
<p><a name="18333"><!-- --></a> In other words, a less
&#34;powerful&#34; domain cannot gain additional permissions as a
result of calling or being called by a more powerful domain.</p>
<p><a name="16769"><!-- --></a> This discussion of one thread
involving two protection domains naturally generalizes to a thread
that traverses multiple protection domains. A simple and prudent
rule of thumb for calculating permissions is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="16797"><!-- --></a> The permission set of an execution
thread is considered to be the intersection of the permissions of
all protection domains traversed by the execution thread.</li>
<li><a name="29045"><!-- --></a> When a piece of code calls the
<code>doPrivileged</code> method (see below), the permission set of
the execution thread is considered to include a permission if it is
allowed by the said code&#39;s protection domain and by all
protection domains that are called or entered directly or
indirectly subsequently.</li>
</ul>
<a name="25333"><!-- --></a> As you can see, the
<code>doPrivileged</code> method enables a piece of trusted code to
temporarily enable access to more resources than are available
directly to the application that called it. This is necessary in
some situations. For example, an application may not be allowed
direct access to files that contain fonts, but the system utility
to display a document must obtain those fonts, on behalf of the
user. We provide the <code>doPrivileged</code> method for the
system domain to deal with this situation, and the method is in
fact available to all domains.
<p><a name="16813"><!-- --></a> During execution, when access to a
critical system resource (such as file I/O and network I/O) is
requested, the resource-handling code directly or indirectly
invokes a special AccessController class method that evaluates the
request and decides if the request should be granted or denied.</p>
<p><a name="16856"><!-- --></a> Such an evaluation follows and
generalizes the &#34;rule of thumb&#34; given above. The actual way
in which the evaluation is conducted can vary between
implementations. The basic principle is to examine the call history
and the permissions granted to the relevant protection domains, and
to return silently if the request is granted or throw a security
exception if the request is denied.</p>
<p><a name="18324"><!-- --></a> Finally, each domain (system or
application) may also implement additional protection of its
internal resources within its own domain boundary. For example, a
banking application may need to support and protect internal
concepts such as checking accounts, deposits and withdrawals.
Because the semantics of such protection is unlikely to be
predictable or enforceable by the Java 2 SDK, the protection system
at this level is best left to the system or application developers.
Nevertheless, whenever appropriate, we provide helpful primitives
to simplify developers&#39; tasks. One such primitive is the
SignedObject class, whose detail we will describe later.</p>
