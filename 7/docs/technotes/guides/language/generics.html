<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Generics</h1></div>
<br />
<!-- Body text begins here -->
<p>When you take an element out of a <code>Collection</code>, you
must cast it to the type of element that is stored in the
collection. Besides being inconvenient, this is unsafe. The
compiler does not check that your cast is the same as the
collection's type, so the cast can fail at run time.</p>
<p>Generics provides a way for you to communicate the type of a
collection to the compiler, so that it can be checked. Once the
compiler knows the element type of the collection, the compiler
can check that you have used the collection consistently and can
insert the correct casts on values being taken out of the
collection.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example taken from the existing Collections
tutorial:</p>

<pre>
// Removes 4-letter words from c. <strong>Elements must be strings</strong>
static void expurgate(Collection c) {
    for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<strong>((String) i.next())</strong>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
<p>Here is the same example modified to use generics:</p>

<pre>
<a name="expurgate" id=
"expurgate">// Removes the 4-letter words from c</a>
static void expurgate(Collection<strong>&lt;String&gt;</strong> c) {
    for (Iterator<strong>&lt;String&gt;</strong> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
      if (<strong>i.next()</strong>.length() == 4)
        i.remove();
}
</pre>
<p>When you see the code <code>&lt;Type&gt;</code>, read it as
"of <code>Type</code>"; the declaration above reads as
"<code>Collection</code> of <code>String c</code>. The code
using generics is clearer and safer. We have eliminated an unsafe
cast and a number of extra parentheses. More importantly, we have
moved part of the specification of the method from a comment to
its signature, so the compiler can verify at compile time that
the type constraints are not violated at run time. Because the
program compiles without warnings, we can state with certainty
that it will not throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at run
time. The net effect of using generics, especially in large
programs, is improved readability and robustness.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Generics Specification Lead Gilad Bracha, when
we declare <code>c</code> to be of type
<code>Collection&lt;String&gt;</code>, this tells us something
about the variable <code>c</code> that holds true wherever and
whenever it is used, and the compiler guarantees it (assuming the
program compiles without warnings). A cast, on the other hand,
tells us something the programmer thinks is true at a single
point in the code, and the VM checks whether the programmer is
right only at run time.</p>
<p>While the primary use of generics is collections, there are
many other uses. "Holder classes," such as <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html"><code>WeakReference</code></a>
and <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html"><code>ThreadLocal</code></a>,
have all been <i>generified</i>, that is, they have been
retrofitted to make use of generics. More surprisingly, class
<a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/Class.html"><code>Class</code></a> has
been generified. Class literals now function as <i>type
tokens</i>, providing both run-time and compile-time type
information. This enables a style of static factories exemplified
by the <code>getAnnotation</code> method in the new <a href=
"../../../api/java/lang/reflect/AnnotatedElement.html"><code>AnnotatedElement</code></a>
interface:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;T extends Annotation&gt; T getAnnotation(Class&lt;T&gt; annotationType); 
</pre>
This is a <i>generic method</i>. It infers the value of its
<i>type parameter</i> <code>T</code> from its argument, and
returns an appropriate instance of <code>T</code>, as illustrated
by the following snippet:
<pre>
    Author a = Othello.class.getAnnotation(Author.class);
</pre>
Prior to generics, you would have had to cast the result to
<code>Author</code>. Also you would have had no way to make the
compiler check that the actual parameter represented a subclass
of <code>Annotation</code>.
<p>Generics are implemented by <i>type erasure</i>: generic type
information is present only at compile time, after which it is
<i>erased</i> by the compiler. The main advantage of this
approach is that it provides total interoperability between
generic code and legacy code that uses non-parameterized types
(which are technically known as <i>raw</i> types). The main
disadvantages are that parameter type information is not
available at run time, and that automatically generated casts may
fail when interoperating with ill-behaved legacy code. There is,
however, a way to achieve guaranteed run-time type safety for
generic collections even when interoperating with ill-behaved
legacy code.</p>
<p>The <code>java.util.Collections</code> class has been
outfitted with wrapper classes that provide guaranteed run-time
type safety. They are similar in structure to the synchronized
and unmodifiable wrappers. These "checked collection wrappers"
are very useful for debugging. Suppose you have a set of strings,
<code>s</code>, into which some legacy code is mysteriously
inserting an integer. Without the wrapper, you will not find out
about the problem until you read the problem element from the
set, and an automatically generated cast to <code>String</code>
fails. At this point, it is too late to determine the source of
the problem. If, however, you replace the declaration:</p>
<pre>
    Set&lt;String&gt; s = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
</pre>
with this declaration:
<pre>
    Set&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.checkedSet(new HashSet&lt;String&gt;(), String.class);
</pre>
the collection will throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> at
the point where the legacy code attempts to insert the integer.
The resulting stack trace will allow you to diagnose and repair
the problem.
<p>You should use generics everywhere you can. The extra effort
in generifying code is well worth the gains in clarity and type
safety. It is straightforward to use a generic library, but it
requires some expertise to write a generic library, or to
generify an existing library. There is one caveat: You may not
use generics (or any other Tiger features) if you intend to
deploy the compiled code on a pre-5.0 virtual machine.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with C++'s <i>template</i> mechanism, you
might think that generics are similar, but the similarity is
superficial. Generics do not generate a new class for each
specialization, nor do they permit "template
metaprogramming."</p>
<p>There is much more to learn about generics. See the <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html">Generics</a> lesson in the Java Tutorials.</p>
