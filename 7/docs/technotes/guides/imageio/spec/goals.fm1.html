<p><u><b>CHAPTER 2</b></u> <a name="5529"><!-- --></a></p>
<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Goals</h1></div>
<h2><a name="996730"><i>2.1</i> API Goals</a></h2>
<a name="996882"><!-- --></a> The design of the Image I/O API was
influenced by the desire to support a number of primary goals. Each
goal provides the justification for a particular set of API
features. These goals may be divided into those motivated mainly by
the needs of client-side applications, and those motivated by the
needs of server applications. Naturally, these primary goals
represent only a fraction of the capabilities of the API. They are
listed here in order to provide a sense of the motivations that
went into the design of the API.
<p><a name="997049"><!-- --></a> As a general rule of thumb,
whenever a tradeoff between ease of use for application developers
and plug-in developers was identified, the application developer
was given a higher priority. Since relatively few users of the API
are expected to write plug-ins, and even those developers who do
write plug-ins will typically write no more than a handful in order
to support formats of immediate use to them, it makes sense to push
complexity into the plug-ins rather than into applications.</p>
<p><a name="997059"><!-- --></a> To ameliorate the complexity of
plug-in development, some utility methods and implementation
classes are provided that perform common functions. However, it is
not possible to provide implementation classes to cover every
situation, and providing an excessive number of utility classes and
methods would increase the footprint for all API users even if they
did not use non-standard plug-ins. We expect that plug-in
developers will be able to incorporate source code from existing
plug-ins and sample code into their plug-ins. While this might lead
to some redundancy when using multiple, independently developed
plug-ins, most users will probably use only a small number of
plug-ins at a time in any case. Thus, we believe the cost of having
to load code that might theoretically be shared but actually is not
will tend to outweight the cost of loading some redundant code when
many plug-ins are used.</p>
<p><a name="997065"><!-- --></a></p>
<br />
<h3><a name="997066"><!-- --></a> <i>2.1.1</i> Client-Side
Application Goals</h3>
<a name="996980"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Pluggability</b></i> <a name=
"996975"><!-- --></a> An application written to use the Image I/O
API should be able to automatically take advantage of new plug-ins
without any rewriting or recompilation. This requires that plug-ins
follow, as much as possible, a set of format-neutral interfaces.
However, every image format has unique properties and capabilities,
which plug-ins must be able to expose to applications. This is
accomplished by allowing plug-ins to extend a number of interfaces
within the API. Applications that are unaware of the plug-in
specific extensions may continue to make use of the normal plug-in
capabilities, while aware applications may use the extended
interfaces.
<p><a name="996991"><!-- --></a> Both generic and plug-in specific
access to metadata (non-image data) is supported by allowing
plug-ins to provide access to metadata in multiple formats. These
may include plug-in specific formats, a plug-in neutral format
defined by the API, and industry standard formats.</p>
<a name="996893"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Automatic and Manual Plug-in
Installation and Selection</b></i> <a name="996930"><!-- --></a>
For simple applications that wish to load images without user
intervention, it is important to allow a reader plug-in to be
selected automatically based on file contents. However, it is
desirable to avoid the loading and instantiation of complex classes
unless they are needed. A plug-in must be able to determine whether
it can handle a particular image without loading all of its code.
In order to meet this goal, plug-ins are instantiated via a service
provider interface mechanism that allows simple queries to be
performed without loading the main body of plug-in code.
<p><a name="996946"><!-- --></a> All of the bytecode (.class) files
associated with a plug-in may be combined into a JAR file, which
may be installed permanently into a Java Runtime Environment, or
loaded dynamically using the application <code>CLASSPATH</code>
mechanism.</p>
<a name="996939"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Manual Plug-in
Selection</b></i> <a name="996947"><!-- --></a> Although automatic
plug-in selection is convenient for many applications, it must be
possible for more sophisticated applications to exercise greater
control over the plug-in selection process. This is accomplished by
means of a run-time registry of plug-ins that may be queried and
manipulated by an application. <a name="996928"><!-- --></a>
<i><b>Network, Disk-based, and Direct I/O</b></i> <a name="996948">
<!-- --></a> Increasingly, applications must deal with both
disk-based and network-based data. In many cases, even disk-based
data must be dealt with in the form of an <code>InputStream</code>
due to the needs of other APIs. The Image I/O API offers a set of
interfaces that allow data from <code>File</code>s,
<code>InputStream</code>s, or other sources to be handled in a
unified manner while preserving the ability to seek backwards and
forwards. The API is future-proofed to allow new I/O interfaces,
including direct interfaces to image acquisition and output
devices, to be used without rewriting application code. <a name=
"996954"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Access to Metadata</b></i> <a name=
"996955"><!-- --></a> The metadata stored alongside an image may be
as important as the image data. The Java Image I/O API provides
thorough yet flexible access to metadata. Since metadata may take
many forms, and contain very specialized information, it is
difficult to provide direct access to such metadata in a
general-purpose API. Instead, the API requires plug-ins to cast
their metadata into the form of an XML Document structure, possibly
enhanced with <code>Object</code> references in addition to textual
data. Once this has been done, the metadata may be accessed and
edited using standard XML DOM (Document Object Model) interfaces.
The syntax of the <code>Document</code>s will vary from plug-in to
plug-in, but the structure may be traversed, displayed, and edited
without specific knowledge of the plug-in being used. <a name=
"997004"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Support for Advanced
Applications</b></i> <a name="997010"><!-- --></a> In order to
support advanced applications, the API must provide access to
features such as &#34;thumbnail&#34; images, multiple images stored
in a file, muli-resolution imagery, and tiled imagery. It must
provide the capability to decode portions of a larger image, and to
perform subsampling during decoding in order to allow panning over
very large images. When writing images, it must be possible to
write image data piece-by-piece, without storing the entire image
in memory at once.<br />
<h3><a name="997020"><!-- --></a> <i>2.1.2</i> Server Use
Cases</h3>
<a name="996929"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Dynamic image
generation</b></i> <a name="996897"><!-- --></a> Modern web servers
typically generate a large portion of their content dynamically.
The Java Servlet and Java Server Pages (JSP) APIs provide portable
ways to generate HTML pages in response to requests from web
browsers. Just as unique, custom HTML may be generated for each
user, it is possible to customize image content.
<p><a name="996901"><!-- --></a> In many cases, image content must
be generated dynamically. For example, consider supplying stock
price charts. While it might be possible to generate and store a
limited set of charts for each listed stock in advance, if the user
is allowed to add customizations such as the time interval over
which the price should be displayed, or a set of indices or other
stocks against which the stock price should be compared, the number
of possible images grows exponentially. Only a dynamic approach can
possibly allow such customization.</p>
<a name="996949"><!-- --></a> <i><b>Image Customization</b></i>
<a name="996950"><!-- --></a> Web images are typically
one-size-fits-all, with the same image data being delivered
regardless of the display capabilities of the receiver. The
increasing use of wireless and handheld devices will require images
that are customized for their limited bandwidth and display
capabilities. Desktop computers have seen increases in their
display resolution, causing many web images to appear too small.
The lack of scalable images also causes problems for visually
impaired users. Server-side image customization can be used to
provide optimal images for all users, with the image resolution and
color characteristics being chosen based on user preferences.<br />
