<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Java<sup>&trade; Platform Debugger Architecture
-<br />
Service Provider Interfaces</sup></h1></div>
<p><sup>J2SE 5.0 adds new service provider interfaces to the Java
Debug Interface (JDI) so that Connector and TransportService
implementations can be developed and deployed. TransportService is
a new class in 5.0. It represents the underlying transport service
used by a Connector and is used to establish connections and
transport Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets between a
debugger and a target VM.</sup></p>
<p><sup>In addition to new service provider interfaces in JDI, J2SE
5.0 also includes a new transport library interface called the
<a href="jdwpTransport.html">Java&trade; Debug Wire Protocol
Transport Interface (jdwpTransport)</a>. This is a native (C/C++)
interface to allow the development and deployment of transport
libraries. A transport library is loaded by the debuggee-side JDWP
agent and is used to establish a connection to the debugger and to
transport JDWP packets between the debugger and the VM.</sup></p>
<p><sup>This page describes a number of scenarios where the new
interfaces may be used. It also provides an overview of the tasks
involved in developing and deploying new Connectors and transport
implementations.</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup><a href="#Examples">Example Scenarios</a></sup></li>
<li><sup><a href="#ConnectorDev">Developing a
Connector</a></sup></li>
<li><sup><a href="#ConnectorDeploy">Deploying a
Connector</a></sup></li>
<li><sup><a href="#TransportDev">Developing a
TransportService</a></sup></li>
<li><sup><a href="#TransportDeploy">Deploying a
TransportService</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<sup><a name="Examples" id="Examples"></a></sup>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3" />
<h2><sup>Example Scenarios</sup></h2>
<p><sup>The service provider interfaces and the native transport
interface are expected to be used by the following classes of
users:</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>Debugger and tool vendors that need to develop new
LaunchingConnector implementations or wish to provide additional
transport options for remote debugging over-and-beyond the TCP/IP
and shared memory transports provided by Sun.</sup></li>
<li><sup>Embedded device, operating system, or virtual machine
vendors that require remote debugging using transports that than
TCP/IP.</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>Given the above class of user the following describes a
number of scenarios where the new interfaces might be
used.</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>In many environments, particularly embedded devices, the
debugger may be required to connect to a target VM using a
transport other than TCP/IP. In this type of environment the new
service provider interfaces can be used to develop and support
debugging over an alternative transport.</sup>
<p><sup>On the debuggee-side a transport library for the new
transport can be developed by implementing the jdwpTransport
interface. For the debugger, a TransportService implementation can
be developed. When the TransportService implementation is deployed,
the JDI VirtualMachineManager implementation will automatically
create an AttachingConnector and a ListeningConnector to allow
remote debugging to the target VM.</sup></p>
</li>
<li><sup>In some environments the debugger may be required to
connect to a target VM using a mechanism other than a transport.
For example, the debugger may be used to attach, in a read-only
manner, to a crash dump or to a hung process.</sup>
<p><sup>For these examples, an AttachingConnector implementation
can be developed. The AttachingConnector implementation extends
com.sun.jdi.connect.AttachingConnectors and when deployed it will
appear on the list of attaching connectors returned by the
VirtualMachineManager's attachingConnectors() method.</sup></p>
</li>
<li><sup>In many environments the target VM will be launched in a
very proprietary way. In such environments the Connector arguments
or launch mechanism used by the Sun-provided
com.sun.jdi.CommandLineLaunch LaunchingConnector may not be
sufficient. In such cases the operating system or virtual machine
vendor may decide to develop their own LaunchingConnector that is
capable of launching the target VM. This new LaunchingConnector
would have appropriate Connector arguments which would be used to
configure the target VM for debugging. Once deployed it will appear
on the list of Connectors returned by the VirtualMachineManager's
launchingConnectors() method.</sup></li>
<li><sup>Another example arises in enterprise environments where an
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) implementer wishes to
support debugging over a non-Sun provided transport. For example an
IDE may wish to provide the option of debugging over a secure
connection using TLS/SSL.</sup>
<p><sup>In this example the IDE implementer develops a transport
library using the jdwpTransport interface. This allows the debuggee
to use the new transport. On the debugger-side the IDE implementer
has a choice. One option is to develop and deploy a
TransportService implementation. This option would allow the new
transport to be used for remote debugging.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Alternatively, the IDE implementer may decide to create a
Connector implementation that encapsulates the transport. This
option is appropriate when the IDE implementer wishes to add new
Connector arguments. For example, with a secure transport the IDE
implementer may wish to have a Connector that has Connector
arguments to specify keystore, pass phrase, or other options needed
to configure the secure connection. If a new Connector is
appropriate then the IDE implementer develops a transport library
for the debuggee-side and a Connector for the debugger-side. The
type of Connector is the choice of the implementer - one example is
a LaunchingConnector that launches the debuggee and establishes a
secure connection between the debugger and debuggee.</sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<sup><a name="ConnectorDev" id="ConnectorDev"></a></sup>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3" />
<h2><sup>Developing a Connector</sup></h2>
<sup>Developing a Connector involves creating a concrete
implementation of a LaunchingConnector, AttachingConnector, or
ListeningConnector.</sup>
<p><sup>Every Connector implementation must have a public no-arg
constructor in addition to implementing all the Connector methods.
The constructor will be called by the VirtualMachineManager during
initialization. The constructor may be a no-op or it may perform
initialization tasks such as loading a transport service. The
constructor does not throw any checked exceptions so any problems
during initialization should be thrown as Errors or other unchecked
exceptions.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Connectors are not required to use a TransportService. Some
Connectors may connect to the target VM using a mechanism other
than a transport (in the <a href="#Examples">Example Scenarios</a>
section we list the examples of AttachingConnectors that attach to
crash dumps or hung processes). For Connectors that use a
TransportService implementation the Connector can either reference
the TransportService implementation directly or it can load the
implementation at runtime. Connectors that wish to make use of Sun
provided transports should load the transport service using code
such as following:</sup></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup>try {
    Class c = Class.forName("com.sun.tools.jdi.SocketTransportService");
    ts = (TransportService)c.newInstance();
} catch (Exception x) {
    throw new Error(x);
}
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>Java SE implementations are not required to include Sun's
socket or shared memory transport service implementations so in the
above example an Error will be thrown if the transport service does
not exist.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Assuming that the type of Connector is known then the
following items should be noted when developing the
implementation:</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>The list of Connector.Arguments should be carefully
considered. For some Connector implementations the default argument
construction and parsing may be the bulk of the code in the
implementation.</sup></li>
<li><sup>A Connector is required to name the transport that it
uses. If an implementation uses an existing TransportService then
the recommended transport name is the name of the underlying
TransportService. That is, the Connector's transport()
implementation returns a Transport for which the name() method
returns a java.lang.String representing the name of the
transport.</sup></li>
<li><sup>Most Connector implementations will establish a Connection
to a target VM. Once established the Connector's launch, attach, or
accept method will return a VirtualMachine instance to the
debugger. To facilitate the creation of a VirtualMachine mirror the
VirtualMachineManager has a new method in 5.0 to create a
VirtualMachine. The following code fragment shows an example usage
of this method:</sup>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup>VirtualMachine vm = Bootstrap.virtualMachineManager().createVirtualMachine(conn);
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>VirtualMachineManager also involves another form of the
createVirtualMachine for use by LaunchingConnectors. The other form
allows the LaunchingConnector to specify the java.lang.Process that
represents the debuggee. See the specification for
com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachineManager for further details.</sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><sup>The source code for an example LaunchingConnector can be
found <a href="SimpleLaunchingConnector.java">here</a>. The
Connector has a single Connector.Argument called <em>class</em>
which specifies the class name of class to run in the target VM.
The example demonstrates all of the above points including
Connector.Argument, transport naming, and the use of the
createVirtualMachine method. <a name="ConnectorDeploy" id=
"ConnectorDeploy"></a></sup></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3" />
<h2><sup>Deploying a Connector</sup></h2>
<p><sup>To deploy a Connector requires packaging the classes for
the Connector implementation into a jar file along with a service
configuration file that lists the fully-qualified class name of the
Connector. The jar file is then deployed in a location that is
visible to the system class loader.</sup></p>
<p><sup>The service configuration file that must be included in the
jar file is named META-INF/services/com.sun.jdi.connect.Connector.
The file simply lists the full-qualified class names of the
Connector included in the jar file. Multiple Connector
implementations may be included in the same jar file and in that
case the class name for each Connector is listed on a separate
line.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Suppose we wish to deploy a launching connector named
SimpleLaunchingConnector. In order to deploy this we create a file
META-INF/services/com.sun.jdi.connect.Connector similar to the
following:</sup></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup># Our very simple launching connector
SimpleLaunchingConnector
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>This service configuration file is then packaged into a jar
file along with the classes that comprise the implementation of the
Connector:</sup></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup>jar cf SimpleLaunchingConnector.jar \
    META-INF/services/com.sun.jdi.connect.Connector \
    SimpleLaunchingConnector.class
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>The jar file is then copied into a location that is visible
to the system class loader.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Once deployed the Connector will be located by the debugger
when the debugger is restarted. That is, SimpleLaunchingConnector
will be included in the list of Connectors returned by
VirtualMachineManager's allConnectors() method. In addition, as
this is a launching connector, it will also appear on the list of
launching connectors returned by the launchingConnectors() method.
<a name="TransportDev" id="TransportDev"></a></sup></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3" />
<h2><sup>Developing a TransportService</sup></h2>
<p><sup>Developing a transport service requires developing two
components :-</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>A concrete implementation of
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService.</sup></li>
<li><sup>A debuggee-side shared library that implements the
jdwpTransport interface.</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>The development of a transport service requires a high
degree of familiarity with the transport and the underlying
communication protocol. A transport service essentially binds JDWP
to an underlying communication protocol. The service that it
provides is reliable and JDWP packets are exchanged between the
debugger and debuggee without duplication or data loss. Given that
packets must be exchanged in a reliable manner might mean that
additional protocol support be included in the transport service
over and beyond that provided by the underlying communication
protocol. For example, if debugging over a raw and unreliable
serial connection is required, then the transport service
implementer may be required to build in error detection and
recovery in the implementation to ensure that JDWP packets can be
reliably transported between the debugger and the
debuggee.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Assuming the details of the transport and underlying
communication protocol are understood then the next step is to
consider the following:</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><sup>The TransportService's capabilities() method returns a
TransportService.Capabilities to indicate the transport service's
capabilities. The transport service implementer thus needs to
consider:</sup>
<ul>
<li><sup>Can the transport can support multiple concurrent
connections to a single listener address?</sup></li>
<li><sup>Can timeouts be feasibly implemented when connecting,
handshaking, or waiting for a connection to be
established?</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><sup>The native transport library may be used by only one, or
multiple JDWP (or other) agents at the same time. If a transport
supports multiple environments then each call to the
jdwpTransport_OnLoad function will return a new environment
pointer. If a transport only supports a single environment then
second and subsequent calls to jdwpTransport_OnLoad will return an
error. The transport library implementer must therefore decide if
the library implementation will support one or multiple
environments.</sup></li>
<li><sup>Addresses, or connection-endpoints, are represented by
Strings. The implementer must therefore design an address scheme so
that all the components of an address can be encoded into a String.
For example the address and configuration of a serial port might be
encoded as something like:</sup>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup>/dev/ttya;9600,1
</sup>
</pre></li>
<li><sup>Design an appropriate ListenKey implementation. As a
TransportService may be used to listen on multiple, yet different,
addresses at the same time the listen key is used to uniquely
identify each "listener".</sup></li>
<li><sup>Decide on an appropriate name and description for the
TransportService. At start-up the VirtualMachineManager will create
an Attaching and Listening Connector to encapsulate the transport
service. The name and description of these Connectors will be based
on the name and description of the transport service - for example,
if the TransportService's name() method returns "Serial" then the
Connectors created by the VirtualMachineManager will be named
"SerialAttach" and "SerialListen".</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>Once the above have been resolved then creating a
TransportService involves extending
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService and providing an
implementation. The attach and accept methods return an instance of
com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.Connection so an implementation of
Connection is required so that the debugger can exchange JDWP
packets with the debuggee.</sup></p>
<p><sup>As an example of a TransportService implementation the
source code for Sun's socket transport can be found <a href=
"SocketTransportService.java">here</a>. This is provided for
reference purposes only.</sup></p>
<p><sup>To develop a native transport library requires implementing
each of the functions listed in the <a href=
"jdwpTransport.html">jdwpTransport</a> specification. The function
prototypes and definitions are defined in
<tt>${java_home}/include/jdwpTransport.h</tt>.</sup></p>
<p><sup>The transport library implementer compiles and links the
function implementations into a dynamic library (or equivalent).
The library exports a function jdwpTransport_OnLoad function which
the JDWP agent will call when the transport library is loaded. Some
embedded environments don't support dynamic linking and in such
environments the transport library may need to be statically
linked. In that case there isn't any library loading but the
jdwpTransport_OnLoad function will still be called to initialize
the transport library and obtain the environment pointer.</sup></p>
<p><sup>As an example of a jdwpTransport implementation the source
code for Sun's socket transport library (dt_socket) can be found
<a href="socketTransport-example.c">here</a>. This is provided for
references purposes only. <a name="TransportDeploy" id=
"TransportDeploy"></a></sup></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="3" />
<h2><sup>Deploying a TransportService</sup></h2>
<p><sup>A TransportService is deployed in a similar manner to a
Connector. To deploy a TransportService requires packaging the
classes for the TransportService implementation into a jar file
along with a service configuration file that lists the
fully-qualified class name of the TransportService. The jar file is
then deployed in a location that is visible to the system class
loader.</sup></p>
<p><sup>The service configuration file that must be included in the
jar file is named
META-INF/services/com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService. As per
Connector deployment the configuration file may list the classes
names of multiple transport service implementations in the event
that the jar file includes multiple implementations.</sup></p>
<p><sup>In the case of a transport service
com.sun.SerialTransportService then the service configuration file
will be similar to the following :-</sup></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup># Serial line transport
com.foo.SerialTransportService
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>This service configuration file is then packaged into a jar
file along with the classes that comprise the implementation. For
this example we will assume that the implementation involves a
number of classes :-</sup></p>
<pre class="codeblock">
<sup>jar cf SerialTransportService.jar \
    META-INF/services/com.sun.jdi.connect.spi.TransportService \
    com/foo/SerialTransportService.class \
    com/foo/SerialConnection.class \
    com/foo/SerialCapabilities.clas \
    com/foo/SerialIO.class \
    com/foo/SerialProtocol.class 
</sup>
</pre>
<p><sup>As per the deployment of Connectors, the jar file is then
copied into a location that is visible to the system class
loader.</sup></p>
<p><sup>A TransportService may have native methods or rely on other
APIs that require a native library. In that case the native library
must be location that allows it be loaded using
System.loadLibrary.</sup></p>
<p><sup>A native transport library is loaded by the JDWP agent. In
must be located on the normal runtime library search path for the
operating systems. For example, on Solaris or Linux systems it must
be on search path specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.</sup></p>
