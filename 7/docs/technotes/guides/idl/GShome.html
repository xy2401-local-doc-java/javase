<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Getting Started with Java&trade; IDL</h1></div>
Java&trade; IDL is a technology for
distributed objects &ndash; that is, objects interacting on different
platforms across a network. Java IDL enables objects to interact
regardless of whether they're written in the Java programming
language or another language such as C, C++, COBOL, or others.
<p>This is possible because Java IDL is based on the Common Object
Request Brokerage Architecture (CORBA), an industry-standard
distributed object model. A key feature of CORBA is IDL, a
language-neutral Interface Definition Language. Each language that
supports CORBA has its own IDL mapping--and as its name implies,
Java IDL supports the mapping for Java. To learn more about the
IDL-to-Java language mapping, see <a href=
"mapping/jidlMapping.html">IDL-to-Java Language Mapping</a>.</p>
<p>To support interaction between objects in separate programs,
Java IDL provides an Object Request Broker, or ORB. The ORB is a
class library that enables low-level communication between Java IDL
applications and other CORBA-compliant applications.</p>
<p>This tutorial teaches the basic tasks needed to build a CORBA
distributed application using Java IDL. You will build the classic
"Hello World" program as a distributed application. The Hello World
program has a single operation that returns a string to be
printed.</p>
<p>Any relationship between distributed objects has two sides: the
client and the server. The server provides a remote interface, and
the client calls a remote interface. These relationships are common
to most distributed object standards, including Java Remote Method
Invocation (<a href="../rmi/index.html">RMI</a>, <a href=
"../rmi-iiop/index.html">RMI-IIOP</a>) and <a href=
"http://www.omg.org/corba/">CORBA</a>. Note that in this context,
the terms client and server define object-level rather than
application-level interaction--any application could be a server
for some objects and a client of others. In fact, a single object
could be the client of an interface provided by a remote object and
at the same time implement an interface to be called remotely by
other objects.</p>
<p>This figure shows how a one-method distributed object is shared
between a CORBA client and server to implement the classic
&quot;Hello World&quot; application.</p>

"bottom" naturalsizeflag="3" alt="" />
<em><font size="-1">A one-method distributed object shared
between a CORBA client and server.</font></em>
<p>On the client side, the application includes a reference for the
remote object. The object reference has a stub method, which is a
stand-in for the method being called remotely. The stub is actually
wired into the ORB, so that calling it invokes the ORB's connection
capabilities, which forwards the invocation to the server.</p>
<p>On the server side, the ORB uses skeleton code to translate the
remote invocation into a method call on the local object. The
skeleton translates the call and any parameters to their
implementation-specific format and calls the method being invoked.
When the method returns, the skeleton code transforms results or
errors, and sends them back to the client via the ORBs.</p>
<p>Between the ORBs, communication proceeds by means of a shared
protocol, IIOP--the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. IIOP, which is
based on the standard TCP/IP internet protocol, defines how
CORBA-compliant ORBs pass information back and forth. Like CORBA
and IDL, the IIOP standard is defined by OMG, the Object Management
Group.</p>
<h2>The Java IDL Development Process and the Hello World
Tutorial</h2>
This tutorial teaches the basic tasks in building a CORBA
distributed application using Java IDL. You will build the classic
"Hello World" program as a distributed application. The "Hello
World" program has a single operation that returns a string to be
printed.
<p>Despite its simple design, the Hello World program lets you
learn and experiment with all the tasks required to develop almost
any CORBA program that uses static invocation. The following steps
provide a general guide to designing and developing a distributed
object application with Java IDL. Links to the relevant steps of
the tutorial will guide you through creating this sample
application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Define the remote interface
<p>You define the interface for the remote object using the OMG's
Interface Definition Langauge (IDL). You use IDL instead of the
Java language because the <code class="Code">idlj</code> compiler
automatically maps from IDL, generating all Java language stub and
skeleton source files, along with the infrastructure code for
connecting to the ORB. Also, by using IDL, you make it possible for
developers to implement clients and servers in any other
CORBA-compliant language.</p>
<p>Note that if you're implementing a client for an existing CORBA
service, or a server for an existing client, you would get the IDL
interfaces from the implementer--such as a service provider or
vendor. You would then run the <code class="Code">idlj</code>
compiler over those interfaces and follow these steps.</p>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GSIDL.html">Writing the IDL file</a></b> in
this tutorial walks you through defining the remote interface for
the simple "Hello World" example.</p>
</li>
<li>Compile the remote interface
<p>When you run the <code class="Code">idlj</code> compiler over
your interface definition file, it generates the Java version of
the interface, as well as the class code files for the stubs and
skeletons that enable your applications to hook into the ORB.</p>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GSIDL.html#compiling">Mapping Hello.idl to
Java</a></b> in this tutorial walks you through these steps for the
simple "Hello World" example.</p>
</li>
<li>Implement the server
<p>Once you run the <code>idlj</code> compiler, you can use the
skeletons it generates to put together your server application. In
addition to implementing the methods of the remote interface, your
server code includes a mechanism to start the ORB and wait for
invocation from a remote client.</p>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GSserver.html">Developing the Hello World
Server</a></b> walks you through writing a simple server for the
"Hello World" application.</p>
</li>
<li>Implement the client
<p>Similarly, you use the stubs generated by the <code class=
"Code">idlj</code> compiler as the basis of your client
application. The client code builds on the stubs to start its ORB,
look up the server using the name service provided with Java IDL,
obtain a reference for the remote object, and call its method.</p>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GSapp.html">Developing a Client
Application</a></b> walks you through writing a simple client
application.</p>
</li>
<li>Start the applications
<p>Once you implement a server and a client, you can start the name
service, then start the server, then run the client.</p>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GScompile.html">Running the Hello World
Application</a></b> walks you through running the server and client
program that together make up the "Hello World" application, and
the name service that enables them to find one another.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b><a href="tutorial/GSstring.html">Using Stringified Object
References</a></b> walks you through making an object reference
when there is no naming service.</p>
<p><strong><a href="tutorial/jidl2machines.html">Running the Hello
World Application on Two Machines</a></strong> describes one way of
distributing the simple application across two machines - a client
and a server. <a name="FYI" id="FYI"></a></p>
