<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>Chapter 5: Capturing Audio</h1></div>
<p><a name="114180"></a> <em>Capturing</em> refers to the process
of obtaining a signal from outside the computer. A common
application of audio capture is recording, such as recording the
microphone input to a sound file. However, capturing isn't
synonymous with recording, because recording implies that the
application always saves the sound data that's coming in. An
application that captures audio doesn't necessarily store the
audio. Instead it might do something with the data as it's coming
in&mdash;such as transcribe speech into text&mdash;but then discard
each buffer of audio as soon as it's finished with that buffer.</p>
<p><a name="114181"></a> As discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href=
"chapter2.html">Overview of the Sampled Package</a>," a typical
audio-input system in an implementation of the Java Sound API
consists of:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input port, such as a microphone port or a line-in port,
which feeds its incoming audio data into: <a name=
"115691"></a></li>
<li>A mixer, which places the input data in: <a name=
"115692"></a></li>
<li>One or more target data lines, from which an application can
retrieve the data.
<p><a name="113956"></a> Commonly, only one input port can be open
at a time, but an audio-input mixer that mixes audio from multiple
ports is also possible. Another scenario consists of a mixer that
has no ports but instead gets its audio input over a network.</p>
<p><a name="113958"></a> The <code>TargetDataLine</code> interface
was introduced briefly under "<a href="chapter2.html#112445">The
Line Interface Hierarchy</a>" in Chapter 2, "<a href=
"chapter2.html">Overview of the Sampled Package</a>."
<code>TargetDataLine</code> is directly analogous to the
<code>SourceDataLine</code> interface, which was discussed
extensively in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back
Audio</a>." Recall that the <code>SourceDataLine</code> interface
consists of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none"><a name="113960"></a></li>
<li>A <code>write</code> method to send audio to the mixer <a name=
"113961"></a></li>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can
be written to the buffer without blocking
<p><a name="113963"></a></p>
</li>
</ul>
Similarly, <code>TargetDataLine</code> consists of:
<ul>
<li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><a name=
"113965"></a></li>
<li>A <code>read</code> method to get audio from the mixer <a name=
"113966"></a></li>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can
be read from the buffer without blocking</li>
</ul>
<a name="113969"></a>
<h2>Setting Up a TargetDataLine</h2>
<p><a name="113971"></a> The process of obtaining a target data
line was described in Chapter 3, "<a href="chapter3.html">Accessing
Audio System Resources</a>," but we repeat it here for
convenience:</p>
<pre>
<code>TargetDataLine line;
</code><code>DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, <br />    format); // format is an AudioFormat object
</code><code>if (!AudioSystem.isLineSupported(info)) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><code>// Obtain and open the line.
</code><code>try {<br />    line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
</code><code>    line.open(format);
</code><code>} catch (LineUnavailableException ex) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><br /><a name="113992"> </a>
</pre>
You could instead invoke <code>Mixer's</code> <code>getLine</code>
method, rather than <code>AudioSystem's</code>.
<p><a name="113994"></a> As shown in this example, once you've
obtained a target data line, you reserve it for your application's
use by invoking the <code>DataLine</code> method <code>open</code>,
exactly as was described in the case of a source data line in
Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back Audio</a>." The
single-parameter version of the <code>open</code> method causes the
line's buffer to have the default size. You can instead set the
buffer size according to your application's needs by invoking the
two-parameter version:</p>
<pre>
    void open(AudioFormat format, int bufferSize) 
</pre>
When choosing a buffer size, keep in mind the tradeoff between the
delays incurred by long buffers, on the one hand, and the risk of
discontinuities in the audio if the buffers are so short that you
can't retrieve the data fast enough, on the other hand. When
capturing audio, you risk data overflow if you don't pull data from
the filled buffers fast enough. If overflow occurs, some of the
captured data will be discarded, which will probably cause audible
clicks and skips in the sound. This is the opposite situation from
playback, where you risk data underflow, which can result in gaps
in the sound. (See Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back
Audio</a>," for more on choosing buffer sizes.) <a name=
"115741"></a>
<h2>Reading the Data from the TargetDataLine</h2>
<p><a name="114004"></a> Once the line is open, it is ready to
start capturing data, but it isn't active yet. To actually commence
the audio capture, use the <code>DataLine</code> method
<code>start</code>. This begins delivering input audio data to the
line's buffer for your application to read. Your application should
invoke start only when it's ready to begin reading from the line;
otherwise a lot of processing is wasted on filling the capture
buffer, only to have it overflow (that is, discard data).</p>
<p><a name="114006"></a> To start retrieving data from the buffer,
invoke <code>TargetDataLine's</code> read method:</p>
<pre>
int read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) 
</pre>
This method attempts to read <code>length</code> bytes of data into
the array <code>b</code>, starting at the byte position
<code>offset</code> in the array. The method returns the number of
bytes actually read.
<p><a name="114011"></a> As with <code>SourceDataLine's
write</code> method, you can request more data than actually fits
in the buffer, because the method blocks until the requested amount
of data has been delivered, even if you request many buffers' worth
of data.</p>
<p><a name="115205"></a> To avoid having your application hang
during recording, you can invoke the read method within a loop,
until you've retrieved all the audio input, as in this example:</p>
<pre>
// Assume that the TargetDataLine, line, has already
// been obtained and opened.
ByteArrayOutputStream out  = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
int numBytesRead;
byte[] data = new byte[line.getBufferSize() / 5];

// Begin audio capture.
line.start();

// Here, stopped is a global boolean set by another thread.
while (!stopped) {
   // Read the next chunk of data from the TargetDataLine.
   numBytesRead =  line.read(data, 0, data.length);
   // Save this chunk of data.
   out.write(data, 0, numBytesRead);
}     
</pre>
Notice that in this example, the size of the byte array into which
the data is read is set to be one-fifth the size of the line's
buffer. If you instead make it as big as the line's buffer and try
to read the entire buffer, you need to be very exact in your
timing, because data will be dumped if the mixer needs to deliver
data to the line while you are reading from it. By using some
fraction of the line's buffer size, as shown here, your application
will be more successful in sharing access to the line's buffer with
the mixer.
<p><a name="114034"></a> The <code>read</code> method of
<code>TargetDataLine</code> takes three arguments: a byte array, an
offset into the array, and the number of bytes of input data that
you would like to read. In this example, the third argument is
simply the length of your byte array. The <code>read</code> method
returns the number of bytes that were actually read into your
array.</p>
<p><a name="114036"></a> Typically, you read data from the line in
a loop, as in this example. Within the <code>while</code> loop,
each chunk of retrieved data is processed in whatever way is
appropriate for the application&mdash;here, it's written to a
<code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>. Not shown here is the use of a
separate thread to set the boolean <code>stopped</code>, which
terminates the loop. This boolean's value might be set to
<code>true</code> when the user clicks a Stop button, and also when
a listener receives a <code>CLOSE</code> or <code>STOP</code> event
from the line. The listener is necessary for <code>CLOSE</code>
events and recommended for <code>STOP</code> events. Otherwise, if
the line gets stopped somehow without stopped being set to
<code>true</code>, the <code>while</code> loop will capture zero
bytes on each iteration, running fast and wasting CPU cycles. A
more thorough code example would show the loop being re-entered if
capture becomes active again.</p>
<p><a name="114039"></a> As with a source data line, it's possible
to drain or flush a target data line. For example, if you're
recording the input to a file, you'll probably want to invoke the
<code>drain</code> method when the user clicks a Stop button. The
<code>drain</code> method will cause the mixer's remaining data to
get delivered to the target data line's buffer. If you don't drain
the data, the captured sound might seem to be truncated prematurely
at the end.</p>
<p><a name="114041"></a> There might be some cases where you
instead want to flush the data. In any case, if you neither flush
nor drain the data, it will be left in the mixer. This means that
when capture recommences, there will be some leftover sound at the
beginning of the new recording, which might be undesirable. It can
be useful, then, to flush the target data line before restarting
the capture.</p>
<a name="114432"></a>
<h2>Monitoring the Line's Status</h2>
<p><a name="114046"></a> Because the <code>TargetDataLine</code>
interface extends <code>DataLine</code>, target data lines generate
events in the same way source data lines do. You can register an
object to receive events whenever the target data line opens,
closes, starts, or stops. For more information, see "<a href=
"chapter4.html#113711">Monitoring the Line's Status</a>" in Chapter
4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back Audio</a>."</p>
<a name="114049"></a>
<h2>Processing the Incoming Audio</h2>
<p><a name="114051"></a> Like some source data lines, some mixers'
target data lines have signal-processing controls, such as gain,
pan, reverb, or sample-rate controls. The input ports might have
similar controls, especially gain controls. For more information on
how to determine whether a line has such controls, and how to use
them if it does, see Chapter 6, "<a href="chapter6.html">Processing
Audio with Controls</a>."</p>
