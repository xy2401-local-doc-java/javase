<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter explains how the different Java SE client
technologies interact with each other. In addition, the chapter
helps you to pinpoint the technology where you might start
troubleshooting your problem.</p>
<a name="gentextid-230" id="gentextid-230"></a>
<h3>1.1 Overview of Java SE Desktop Technologies</h3>
<p>Java SE Desktop consists of several technologies, as described
at the <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/index-jsp-142216.html">
Java SE Desktop Overview site</a>. This guide currently describes
troubleshooting procedures for the following desktop
technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>AWT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java 2D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internationalization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Sound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Java Plug-in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This section explains how the different desktop technologies
interact with each other. It also describes which of the
technologies are more likely to work with native code, or depend on
the environment, for example, the hardware or software
configuration.</p>
<p>The better you understand the relationships among these
technologies, the more quickly you can pinpoint the area your
problem falls into.</p>
<a name="gdhuc" id="gdhuc"></a>
<h4>1.1.1 Introduction to Java SE Desktop</h4>
<p>The Java SE Desktop Java technologies are used to create rich
client applications and applets. The desktop tools and libraries
interface with the core tools and libraries of the platform.</p>
<a name="gdlcq" id="gdlcq"></a>
<h6 class="figuretitle">Overview of Java SE Desktop</h6>
<img src="figures/desktop-overview.gif" alt=
"Overview showing user application on top of desktop technologies, which are on top of core tools and libraries"
title=
"Overview showing user application on top of desktop technologies, which are on top of core tools and libraries" />
<a name="gdhug" id="gdhug"></a>
<h4>1.1.2 AWT</h4>
<p>The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) supports Graphical User
Interface (GUI) programming. This API gives you, the developer, the
following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Construction of components such as menus, buttons, text fields,
dialog boxes, and checkboxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of user input through those components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rendering of simple shapes such as ovals and polygons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control over the user-interface layout and fonts used by your
applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling of native drag-and-drop, events, and cursors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These classes are at the bottom of the software stack (closest
to the underlying operating and desktop system).</p>
<p>AWT also provides a set of heavyweight components.</p>
<p>Purely AWT applications are usually not related to Swing. If an
AWT application does custom rendering, it uses Java 2D.</p>
<a name="gdhuq" id="gdhuq"></a>
<h4>1.1.3 Java 2D</h4>
<p>The Java 2D API is a set of classes for advanced 2D graphics and
imaging. This API enhances the graphics, text, and imaging
capabilities of the AWT.</p>
<p>Java 2D is also at the bottom of the software stack (closest to
the underlying operating and desktop system).</p>
<a name="gdhud" id="gdhud"></a>
<h4>1.1.4 Swing</h4>
<p>The Swing classes are built on top of the AWT and Java 2D
architecture. Swing implements a set of components for building
GUIs and adding rich graphics functionality and interaction to Java
applications, with a pluggable look and feel.</p>
<p>Since Swing is a lightweight toolkit, it has very little
interaction with the native platform. Swing uses Java 2D for
rendering, and AWT provides creation and manipulation of top-level
components, such as Windows, Frames, and Dialogs.</p>
<a name="gdjzu" id="gdjzu"></a>
<h4>1.1.5 Internationalization</h4>
<p>Internationalization is the process of designing software so
that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without
engineering changes.</p>
<a name="gdhve" id="gdhve"></a>
<h4>1.1.6 Sound</h4>
<p>Java Sound provides a low-level API to control the input and
output of sound operations, including capturing, processing, and
playing back audio and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
data.</p>
<a name="gdhus" id="gdhus"></a>
<h4>1.1.7 Plug-in</h4>
<p>Java Plug-in extends the functionality of a web browser by
allowing applets or Java Beans to be run under the Java SE runtime
environment (JRE) rather than the Java runtime environment that is
delivered with the web browser.</p>
<a name="gceym" id="gceym"></a>
<h3>1.2 General Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
<p>The following list provides some advice that can help you in
troubleshooting a problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the symptom.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the type of issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the problem area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note relevant configuration information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate non-issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure the correct patches, drivers, and operating systems
are installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try earlier releases (back-tracing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize the test. Restrict the test to as few issues at a time
as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimize the hardware and software configuration. Determine if
the problem is reproducible on single and multiple systems.
Determine if the problem changes with the browser version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if the problem depends on whether multiple VMs are
installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check for typical causes in the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use flags to change defaults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use tracing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In exceptional cases, use system properties to temporarily
change the behavior of the painting system. Several unsupported
properties are described on the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/2d/flags.html">
System Properties for Java 2D Technology page</a>.</p>

<p>Find the fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find a possible workaround.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File a bug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the user's application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <i>Troubleshooting Guide for Java SE 7 with HotSpot VM</i>
provides information that can help in troubleshooting problems
between Java SE applications and the Java HotSpot virtual machine.
A lot of this information can also be applied to problems with
applications that use the Java SE desktop technologies.</p>
<p>See <img class="linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"bugreports.html">Chapter&#160;8, Submitting Bug Reports</a> for
guidance on how to submit a bug report and suggestions on what data
to collect for the report.</p>
<a name="gceyf" id="gceyf"></a>
<h3>1.3 Identifying the Problem Area</h3>
<p>Take a moment to categorize the problem you are experiencing.
This will help you identify the specific area of the problem, find
the cause, and ultimately determine a solution or a workaround.
Some of these issues might seem obvious, but it is always helpful
to consider every possibility and to eliminate what is not an
issue.</p>
<a name="geabz" id="geabz"></a>
<h4>1.3.1 Crashes</h4>
<p>When a crash occurs, an error log is created with information
and the state obtained at the time of the fatal error. The default
name of the error log file is
<tt>hs_err_pid</tt><var>pid</var><tt>.log</tt>. For a standalone
Java application this file is created in the current directory,
while for Java applets it is created in the browser binaries
directory or user client folder.</p>
<p>See <img class="linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"felog.html">Appendix&#160;B, Fatal Error Log</a> for a detailed
description of the fatal error log.</p>
<p>A line near the top of the header section indicates the library
where the error occurred. The example below shows that the crash
was related to the AWT library.</p>
<pre>
...
# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (1.6.0-beta2-b76 mixed mode, sharing)
# Problematic frame:
# C  [awt.dll+0x123456]
...
</pre>
<p>If the crash occurred in JNI native code, it was likely to have
been caused by the desktop libraries. A crash in a native library
typically means a problem in Java 2D or AWT, because Swing does not
have much native code. The small amount of native code in Swing is
mostly concerned with native look and feel, and if your application
is using native look and feel, the crash may be related to this
area.</p>
<p>The error log usually shows the exact library where the crash
occurred, and this can give you a good idea of the cause. Crashes
in libraries which are not part of the JDK usually indicate
problems with the environment, for example, bad video drivers or
desktop managers.</p>
<p>In the case of a VM crash, see the <i>Troubleshooting Guide for
Java SE 7 with HotSpot VM</i>.</p>
<a name="geabw" id="geabw"></a>
<h4>1.3.2 Performance Problems</h4>
<p>Performance problems are harder to diagnose because you
generally do not have as much information.</p>
<p>First, you must determine which technology has the problem. For
example, rendering performance problems are probably in Java 2D,
and responsiveness issues can be Swing-related.</p>
<p>The following are a few examples of performance-related
problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Startup. How long does the application take to start up and
become useful to the user?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Footprint. How much memory does the application take? This can
be measured by tools such as TaskManager on Windows or <tt>top</tt>
and <tt>prstat</tt> on Solaris OS and Linux.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runtime performance. How fast does the application complete the
task it is designed to perform? For example, if the application
computes something, how long does it take to finish the
computations? In the case of a game, is the frame rate acceptable,
does the animation look smooth?</p>
<p>Note that this is not the same as responsiveness, which is the
next topic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsiveness. How fast does the application respond to user
interaction? If the user clicks a menu, how long does it take for
the menu to appear? Can a long-running task be interrupted? Does
the application repaint fast enough so that the application does
not appear to be slow?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="geacp" id="geacp"></a>
<h4>1.3.3 Behavior Problems</h4>
<p>In addition to crashes, various behavior-related problems can
occur. This section presents some of these problems and attempts to
guide you to the Java SE desktop technology to troubleshoot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hangs: The application does not respond to user input. See the
chapter on hanging or looping processes in the <i>Troubleshooting
Guide for Java SE 7 with HotSpot VM</i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceptions in Java code. Exceptions are visibly thrown in the
console or the application log files. An examination of this output
will guide you to the problem area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rendering and repainting issues. For example, the application
has an incorrect appearance after a repaint that was caused by
another application being dragged over. Other examples are
incorrect font, wrong colors, scrolling, damaging the application's
frame by dragging another window over it, and updating a damaged
area. These issues indicate a problem in Java 2D, or perhaps in
Swing.</p>
<p>If your application exhibits repainting issues, the problem is
likely to be with Java 2D or Swing.</p>
<p>A quick test is the following: If the problem is reproducible on
a different platform (for example, the problem was originally seen
on Windows, and it is also present on Solaris OS or Linux), it is
very likely to be a Swing <tt>PaintManager</tt> problem.</p>
<p>See <img class="linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"java2d.html">Chapter&#160;3, Troubleshooting Java 2D</a> for ways
of changing Java 2D rendering pipelines with some flags. This can
also help in determining if the problem is related to Java 2D or to
Swing.</p>
<p>Multiscreen-related repainting issues belong to Java 2D (for
example, repainting problems when moving a window from one screen
to another, or other unusual behavior caused by interaction with a
non-default screen device).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desktop-interaction-related issues indicate a problem in
AWT.</p>
<p>Some examples of desktop-interaction-related issues are resizing
the window, minimizing or maximizing them, focus handling problems,
modality, system Tray or Splashscreens, window placement on the
screen, handling (enumerating) of multiple screens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag-and-drop problems. Drag-and-drop belongs to AWT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Printing problems. Depending on the API that is used, this could
be either in Java 2D or AWT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Font problems.</p>
<p>Font rendering issues in AWT applications might be a problem in
font properties or in internationalization.</p>
<p>However, if your application is purely AWT, the text rendering
problems might be caused by Java 2D. On Solaris OS or Linux the
text rendering is performed by Java 2D. Alternatively, the problem
might be in AWT or in internationalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Painting problems. This is most likely a Swing issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text-rendering quality.</p>
<p>The text rendering in Swing is performed by Java 2D. Therefore,
if your application uses Swing and you have text rendering problems
(such as missing glyphs, incorrect rendering of glyphs, incorrect
spacing between lines or characters, bad quality of the font
rendering), the problem is likely to be in Java 2D.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full-screen issues. This is a Java 2D API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encoding and locales issues (for example, no locale-specific
characters displayed) indicate internalization problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a name="tools" id="tools"></a>
<h3>1.4 Basic Tools</h3>
<p>This section simply lists a few tools that can help in
troubleshooting. The <i>Troubleshooting Guide for Java SE 7 with
HotSpot VM</i> contains detailed information on most of these
tools, as well as many other useful tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Performance: benchmarks, profilers, DTrace, Java probes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Footprint: <tt>jhat</tt>, <tt>jmap</tt>, profilers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crashes: native debuggers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hangs: JConsole, <tt>jstack</tt>, ctrl-break</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for bad fonts: Font2DTest (delivered with the JDK in
<tt>demo/jfc/Font2DTest</tt>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also debug JDK builds from <tt>dev.java.net</tt> for
various issues.</p>
<a name="gchfp" id="gchfp"></a>
<h3>1.5 Using JDWP for Debugging</h3>
<p>JDWP (Java Debugging Wire Protocol) is very useful in debugging
applications as well as applets.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to debug applications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a command line window. Set the <tt>PATH</tt> environment
variable to <var>jdk</var><tt>/bin</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the Java program (called <tt>Test</tt> in this example) to
be debugged as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre>
<b>java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_shmem,address=debug,server=y,suspend=y Test</b>
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>On Solaris OS and Linux:</p>
<pre>
<b>java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8888,server=y,suspend=y Test</b>
</pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <tt>Test</tt> class starts in a debugging mode and waits for
a debugger to attach to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do Java level debugging, open another command line window and
run <tt>jdb</tt> to attach to the above running debug server at
address <tt>debug</tt> (Windows) or <tt>8888</tt> (Solaris OS or
Linux).</p>
<pre>
<b>jdb -attach 'debug'</b>  or  <b>jdb -attach 8888</b>
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>After <tt>jdb</tt> initializes and attaches to <tt>Test</tt>,
set your breakpoints and run.</p>
<pre>
<b>stop in Test.main run</b>
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>The <tt>jdb</tt> utility will hit the breakpoint.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To perform native level debugging along with Java debugging, use
native debuggers to attach to the Java process running with
JDWP.</p>
<p>In Windows, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose Build -&gt; Start Debug -&gt; Attach to Process. Select
the Java process that is running with JDWP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose Project -&gt; Settings -&gt; Additional DLLs. Add the
native <tt>dll</tt> that you want to debug, for example
<tt>Test.dll</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the source file (one or more) of <tt>Test.dll</tt> and set
your breakpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type <tt>cont</tt> in the <tt>jdb</tt> window. The process will
hit the breakpoint in Visual Studio.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On Solaris OS, you can use the <tt>dbx</tt> utility to do native
level debugging, and on Linux you can use the <tt>gdb</tt>
utility.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to debug applets using JDWP:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Launch the Java Control Panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Applet Runtime settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the field Java Runtime Parameters, enter the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre>
Djavaplugin.trace=true -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:
transport=dt_shmem,address=debug,server=y,suspend=y
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>On Solaris OS and Linux:</p>
<pre>
Djavaplugin.trace=true -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:
transport=dt_shmem,address=debug,server=y,suspend=y
</pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you launch a browser and load an applet, the Java plugin
starts in debugging mode and waits for a debugger to attach to it
at the address <tt>debug</tt> (Windows) or <tt>8888</tt> (Solaris
OS or Linux).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <tt>jdb</tt> from a command window and attach to address
<tt>debug</tt> (or <tt>8888</tt>).</p>
<pre>
<b>jdb -attach debug</b>
Initializing jdb ...
VM Started: No frames on the current call stack
main[1]
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>After <tt>jdb</tt> initializes, set the breakpoints, and then
run.</p>
<pre>
<b>sStop in MyApplet.func1 run</b>
</pre></li>
<li>
<p>The applet will run in the browser until it hits the set
breakpoint. Then you can debug the applet, see the control flow,
watch its variables, and so forth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
