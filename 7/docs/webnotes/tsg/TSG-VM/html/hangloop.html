<h2>Troubleshooting Hanging or Looping Processes</h2>
<p>This chapter provides information and guidance on some specific
procedures for troubleshooting hanging or looping processes.</p>
<p>Problems can occur that involve hanging or looping processes. A
hang can occur for many reasons but often stems from a deadlock in
application code, API code, or library code. A hang can even be due
to a bug in the HotSpot virtual machine.</p>
<p>Sometimes an apparent hang turns out to be, in fact, a loop. For
example, a bug in a VM process that causes one or more threads to
go into an infinite loop can consume all available CPU cycles.</p>
<p>An initial step when diagnosing a hang is to find out if the VM
process is idle or consuming all available CPU cycles. To do this
requires using an operating system utility. If the process appears
to be busy and is consuming all available CPU cycles then it is
likely that the issue is a looping thread rather than a deadlock.
On Solaris OS, for example, the command <tt>prstat -L -p
&#60;pid&gt;</tt> can be used to report the statistics for all LWPs
in the target process and thus will identify the threads that are
consuming a lot of CPU cycles.</p>
<a name="gbyzy" id="gbyzy"></a>
<h3>5.1 Diagnosing a Looping Process</h3>
<p>If a VM process appears to be looping, the first step is to try
to get a thread dump. If a thread dump can be obtained, it will
often be clear which thread is looping. If the looping thread can
be identified, then the trace stack in the thread dump can provide
direction on where (and maybe why) the thread is looping.</p>
<p>If the application console (standard input/output) is available,
then press the Ctrl-\ key combination (on Solaris OS or Linux) or
the Ctrl-Break key combination (on Windows) to cause the HotSpot VM
to print a thread dump, including thread state. On Solaris OS and
Linux the thread dump can also be obtained by sending a
<tt>SIGQUIT</tt> to the process (command <tt>kill -QUIT
&#60;pid&gt;</tt>). In this case the thread dump is printed to the
standard output of the target process. The output might be directed
to a file, depending on how the process was started.</p>
<p>If the Java process is started with the
<tt>-XX:+PrintClassHistogram</tt> command-line option, then the
Ctrl-Break handler will produce a heap histogram.</p>
<p>If a thread dump can be obtained, then a good place to start is
the thread stacks of the threads that are in the runnable state.
See <img class="linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"tooldescr.html#gbmpn">2.15.1 Thread Dump</a> for information on
the format of the thread dump, as well as a table of the possible
thread states in the thread dump. In some cases it might be
necessary to get a sequence of thread dumps in order to determine
which threads appear to be continuously busy.</p>
<p>If the application console is not available (process is running
as a background process, or the VM output is directed to an unknown
location), then the <tt>jstack</tt> utility can be used to obtain
the stack thread. Use the <tt>jstack -F</tt> <var>pid</var> option
to force a stack dump of the looping process. See <img class=
"linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"tooldescr.html#gblfh">2.11 <tt>jstack</tt> Utility</a> for
information on the output of this utility. The <tt>jstack</tt>
utility should also be used if the thread dump does not provide any
evidence that a Java thread is looping.</p>
<p>When reviewing the output of the <tt>jstack</tt> utility, focus
initially on the threads that are in the <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> state.
This is the most likely state for threads that are busy and
possibly looping. It might be necessary to execute <tt>jstack</tt>
a number of times to get a more complete picture of which threads
are looping. If a thread appears to be always in the
<tt>RUNNABLE</tt> state, then the <tt>-m</tt> option can be used to
print the native frames and can provide a further hint on what the
thread is doing. If a thread appears to be looping continuously
while in the <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> state, this situation can indicate a
potential HotSpot VM bug that needs further investigation.</p>
<p>If the VM does not respond to a Ctrl-\ this could indicate a VM
bug rather than an issue with application or library code. In this
case use <tt>jstack</tt> with the <tt>-m</tt> option (in addition
to the <tt>-F</tt> option) to get a thread stack for all threads.
The output will include the thread stacks for VM internal threads.
In this stack trace, identify threads that do not appear to be
waiting. For example, on Solaris OS you identify the threads that
are not in functions such as <tt>__lwp_cond_wait</tt>,
<tt>__lwp_park</tt>, <tt>___pollsys</tt>, or other blocking
functions. If it appears that the looping is caused by a VM bug,
then collect as much data as possible and submit a bug report. See
<img class="linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"bugreports.html">Chapter&#160;7, Submitting Bug Reports</a> for
more details on data collection.</p>

<h3>5.2 Diagnosing a Hung Process</h3>
<p>If the application appears to be hung and the process appears to
be idle, then the first step is to try to obtain a thread dump. If
the application console is available, then press the Ctrl-\ keys
(on Solaris OS or Linux) or the Ctrl-Break keys (on Windows) to
cause the HotSpot VM to print a thread dump. On Solaris OS and
Linux the thread dump can also be obtained by sending a
<tt>SIGQUIT</tt> to the process (command <tt>kill -QUIT
&#60;pid&gt;</tt>).</p>
<a name="gbzbf" id="gbzbf"></a>
<h4>5.2.1 Deadlock Detected</h4>
<p>If the hung process is capable of generating a thread dump, then
the output is printed to the standard output of the target process.
After printing the thread dump, the HotSpot VM executes a deadlock
detection algorithm. If a deadlock is detected it will be printed
along with the stack trace of the threads involved in the deadlock.
Below is an example of this output.</p>

Found 1 deadlock.
</pre>
<p>The default deadlock detection works with locks that are
obtained using the <tt>synchronized</tt> keyword, as well as with
locks that are obtained using the <tt>java.util.concurrent</tt>
package. If the Java VM flag <tt>-XX:+PrintConcurrentLocks</tt> is
set, then the stack trace also shows a list of lock owners.</p>
<p>If deadlock is detected, then you must examine the output in
more detail in order to understand the deadlock. In the above
example the thread <tt>main</tt> is locking object
<tt>&#60;0xf0c30560&gt;</tt> and is waiting to enter
<tt>0xf0c41ec8</tt>, which is locked by thread
<tt>AWT-EventQueue-0</tt>. However, thread
<tt>AWT-EventQueue-0</tt> is waiting to enter <tt>0xf0c30560</tt>,
which is locked by <tt>main</tt>.</p>
<p>The detail in the stack traces provides information to help find
the deadlock.</p>
<a name="gbzbe" id="gbzbe"></a>
<h4>5.2.2 Deadlock Not Detected</h4>
<p>If the thread dump is printed and no deadlocks are found, then
the issue might be a bug in which a thread waiting on a monitor
that is never notified. This could be a timing issue or a general
logic bug.</p>
<p>To find out more about the issue, examine each of the threads in
the thread dump and each thread that is blocked in
<tt>Object.wait()</tt>. The caller frame in the stack trace
indicates the class and method that is invoking the <tt>wait()</tt>
method. If the code was compiled with line number information (the
default), then this provides direction as to the code to examine.
In most cases you must have some knowledge of the application logic
or library in order to diagnose this issue further. In general you
must understand how the synchronization works in the application
and in particular the details and conditions for when and where
monitors are notified.</p>
<a name="gbzbv" id="gbzbv"></a>
<h4>5.2.3 No Thread Dump</h4>
<p>If the VM does not respond to a Ctrl-\ or Ctrl-Break, then it is
possible that the VM is deadlocked or hung for some other reason.
In that case use the <tt>jstack</tt> utility (see <img class=
"linkicon" src="graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href=
"tooldescr.html#gblfh">2.11 <tt>jstack</tt> Utility</a>) to obtain
a thread dump. Use the <tt>jstack -F</tt> <var>pid</var> option to
force a stack dump of the hung process. This also applies in the
case where the application is not accessible or the output is
directed to an unknown location.</p>
<p>In the <tt>jstack</tt> output, examine each of the threads in
the <tt>BLOCKED</tt> state. The top frame can sometimes indicate
why the thread is blocked, for example, <tt>Object.wait</tt> or
<tt>Thread.sleep</tt>. The rest of the stack will give an
indication of what the thread is doing. This is particularly true
when the source has been compiled with line number information (the
default) and you can cross reference the source code.</p>
<p>If a thread is in the <tt>BLOCKED</tt> state and the reason is
not clear, then use the <tt>-m</tt> option to get a mixed stack.
With the mixed stack output, it should be possible to identify why
the thread is blocked. If a thread is blocked trying to enter a
synchronized method or block, then you will see frames such as
<tt>ObjectMonitor::enter</tt> near the top of the stack. Below is
an example.</p>
<pre>
----------------- t@13 -----------------
0xff31e8b8      ___lwp_cond_wait + 0x4
0xfea8c810      void ObjectMonitor::EnterI(Thread*) + 0x2b8
0xfeac86b8      void ObjectMonitor::enter2(Thread*) + 0x250
:
</pre>
<p>Threads in the <tt>RUNNABLE</tt> state might also be blocked.
The top frames in the mixed stack should indicate what the thread
is doing.</p>
<p>One specific thread to check is <tt>VMThread</tt>. This is the
special thread used to execute operations like garbage collection.
It can be identified as the thread that is executing
<tt>VMThread::run()</tt> in its initial frames. On Solaris OS it is
typically <tt>t@4</tt>. On Linux it should be identifiable using
the C++ mangled name <tt>_ZN8VMThread4loopEv</tt>.</p>
<p>In general the VM thread is in one of three states: waiting to
execute a VM operation, synchronizing all threads in preparation
for a VM operation, or executing a VM operation. If you suspect
that a hang is a HotSpot VM bug rather than an application or class
library deadlock, then pay special attention to the VM thread.</p>
<p>If the VM thread appears to be stuck in
<tt>SafepointSynchronize::begin</tt>, then this could indicate an
issue bringing the VM to a safepoint. A safepoint indicates that
all threads executing in the VM are blocked and waiting for a
special operation, such as garbage collection, to complete.</p>
<p>If the VM thread appears to be stuck in <tt>function</tt>, where
<tt>function</tt> ends in <tt>doit</tt>, then this could also
indicate a VM problem.</p>
<p>In general, if you can execute the application from the command
line, and you get to a state where the VM does not respond to a
Ctrl-\ or Ctrl-Break, it is more likely that you have uncovered a
VM bug, a thread library issue, or a bug in another library. If
this occurs, obtain a crash dump (see <img class="linkicon" src=
"graphics/linkicon.gif" /><a href="bugreports.html#gbkyy">7.4
Collecting Core Dumps</a> for instructions on how to do this),
gather as much information as possible, and submit a bug report or
support call.</p>
<p>One other tool to mention in the context of hung processes is
the <tt>pstack</tt> utility on Solaris OS. On Solaris 8 and 9 OS,
this utility prints the thread stacks for LWPs in the target
process. On Solaris 10 OS and starting with the JDK 5.0 release,
the output of <tt>pstack</tt> is similar, though not identical, to
the output from <tt>jstack -m</tt>. As with <tt>jstack</tt>, the
Solaris 10 OS implementation of <tt>pstack</tt> prints the fully
qualified class name, method name, and bci. It will also print line
numbers for the cases where the source was compiled with line
number information (the default). This is useful for developers and
administrators who are familiar with the other utilities on Solaris
OS that exercise features of the <tt>/proc</tt> file system.</p>
<p>The equivalent tool of <tt>pstack</tt> on Linux is
<tt>lsstack</tt>. This utility is included in some distributions
and otherwise obtained from the <tt>sourceforge.net</tt> web site.
At the time of this writing, <tt>lsstack</tt> reported native
frames only.</p>

<h3>5.3 Solaris 8 OS Thread Library</h3>
<p>The default thread library on Solaris 8 OS is often referred to
as the T1 library. This thread library implemented the
<var>m</var>:<var>n</var> threading model, where <var>m</var> user
threads are mapped to <var>n</var> kernel-level threads (LWPs).
Solaris 8 OS also shipped with an alternative and newer thread
library in <tt>/usr/lib/lwp</tt>. The alternative thread library is
often referred to as the T2 library, and it became the default
thread library in Solaris 9 and 10 OS. In older releases of J2SE
(pre-1.4.0 in particular) there were a number of issues with the
default thread library, for example, bugs in the thread library,
LWP synchronization problems, or LWP starvation. LWP starvation is
a scenario in which there are user threads in the runnable state
but there are no kernel level threads available.</p>
<p>Although the issues cited are historical, it should be noted
that when the JDK software is deployed on Solaris 8 OS, it still
uses the T1 library by default. LWP starvation type issues do not
arise because the JDK release uses &#8220;bound threads&#8221; so
that each user thread is bound to a kernel thread. However in the
event that you encounter an issue, such as a hang, which you
believe is a thread library issue, then you can instruct the
HotSpot VM to use the T2 library by adding <tt>/usr/lib/lwp</tt> to
the <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>. To check if the T2 library is in use,
issue the command <tt>pldd &#60;pid&gt;</tt> to list the libraries
loaded by the specified process.</p>
