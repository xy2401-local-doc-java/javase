<div class="smallpagetitle"><h1>JDK 7 Adoption Guide</h1></div>
<p>With the release of JDK 7, the Java Language continues to
evolve. New language features make it possible to write tighter,
more robust code. Functionality that was previously difficult to
implement is now made easier. This guide shows, in some detail, why
you should consider migrating from JDK 6 to JDK 7.</p>
<p>In addition to this guide, there are two documents that you
should be aware of when migrating to the JDK 7 release.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="lang" id="lang">Java Language Enhancements</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Most of the Java Language Enhancements introduced in JDK 7 were
a result of JSR 334, supported by <a href=
"http://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/" target="_blank">OpenJDK
Project Coin</a>. The primary goal of this effort was to introduce
language changes that support writing cleaner, more robust
code.</p>
<p>If you use an IDE to develop your applications, it can help
migrate existing code. The NetBeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEs are
all shipping versions that support the Coin features.</p>
<p>The following list details the specific enhancements.</p>
<h3>Performing a <tt>switch</tt> statement on a string</h3>
<p>Prior to JDK 7, it was not possible to perform a
<code>switch</code> on a <code>String</code> object. To achieve
this functionality, you had to use <code>if-then-else</code>
statements. The ability to switch on a string is now supported and
produces more efficient bytecode than an <code>if-then-else</code>
statement. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html">
The switch Statement</a> (Java Tutorial) and <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/strings-switch.html">
Strings in switch Statements</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Writing code with less potential for leaks</h3>
<p>Before JDK 7, any resources that were opened in a
<code>try</code> statement (also called a
<code>try-catch-finally</code> statement) had to be manually
closed, usually in a <tt>finally</tt> block. As of JDK 7, the
<code>try</code>-with-resources statement ensures that any
resources declared in the <code>try</code> statement will be closed
automatically. If multiple resource variables are declared in the
<code>try</code> statement, they are closed in the reverse order
that they are declared. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/try-with-resources.html">
The <tt>try</tt>-with-resources Statement</a> (JDK 7 Guides) and
<a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html">
The <tt>try</tt>-with-resources Statement</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Catching multiple exceptions</h3>
<p>Historically, catching multiple exceptions results in a
<tt>catch</tt> block for each exception, with each block containing
a variable with the type of that particular exception. In many
cases, these <tt>catch</tt> blocks contained identical code that
referenced the specified exception variable. It was difficult to
write a common method to handle this duplicated code because the
exception variables had different types.</p>
<pre>
try {
    Path fp = path.toRealPath(true);
} catch (NoSuchFileException x) {
    System.err.format("%s: no such file or directory%n", path);
    ...
} catch (IOException x) {
    System.err.format("%s%n", x);
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>As of JDK 7, you can catch multiple exceptions in the same
<tt>catch</tt> block using the <code>|</code> symbol.</p>
<pre>
try {
    Path fp = path.toRealPath(true);
} catch (NoSuchFileException | IOException x) {
    System.err.format("%s: no such file or directory%n", path);
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html#multiple">
Handling More Than One Type of Exception</a> (JDK 7 Guides) and
<a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/catch.html">
The catch Blocks</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>More precise re-throw of an exception</h3>
<p>Before JDK 7, re-throwing an exception in a <tt>catch</tt> block
did not indicate the actual exceptions possible from the
<tt>try</tt> block. Also, you could not change the type of
exception thrown in the <tt>catch</tt> block without changing the
method signature. As of JDK 7, the semantics for catching and
throwing exceptions has been refined. If you catch an exception of
some type, and do not assign to the exception variable, the
compiler will copy over the checked exception type that can be
thrown from the <tt>try</tt> block. It is as if you are re-throwing
all the exceptions possible from the <tt>try</tt> block (provided
that you don't re-assign the exception variable). For example, the
following code is legal in JDK 7:</p>
<pre>
JarFile retrieve(URL url) <strong>throws IOException</strong> {
    Path temp = Files.createTempFile("jar_cache", null);
    try (InputStream in = url.openStream()) {
        Files.copy(in, temp, REPLACE_EXISTING);
        return new JarFile(temp.toFile());
    } <strong>catch (Throwable t)</strong> {
        Files.delete(temp);
        <strong>throw t</strong>;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>In this case, the compiler knows that the only possible
exception type is an <tt>IOException</tt> because that is what
<tt>Files.copy</tt> can throw. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html#rethrow">
Rethrowing Exceptions with More Inclusive Type Checking</a> (JDK 7
Guides).</p>
<h3>Diamond syntax for more concise <tt>new</tt> expressions</h3>
<p>Historically, you had to specify type arguments for a generic
class in a <tt>new</tt> expression. As of JDK 7, you can replace
the type arguments with the diamond notation, (<tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>),
to take advantage of automatic type inference. The resulting code
is functionally identical, but more concise and easier to read. For
more information, see <a href=
"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html#type-inference-instantiation">
Type Inference and Instantiation of Generic Classes</a> (Java
Tutorial), and <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/type-inference-generic-instance-creation.html">
Type Inference for Generic Instance Creation</a> (JDK 7
Guides).</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="loaders" id="loaders">Class Loaders</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3>Multithreaded class loading</h3>
<p>Prior to JDK 7, certain types of custom class loaders were prone
to deadlock. In JDK 7, the locking mechanism has been modified to
avoid deadlock. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/lang/cl-mt.html">
Multithreaded Custom Class Loaders in Java SE 7</a> (JDK 7
Guides).</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="concurrency" id="concurrency">Concurrency</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3>More scalable code using fork/join framework on multiple
processors</h3>
<p>Introduced in the JDK 7 release, the <tt>fork/join</tt>
framework uses the <tt>ExecutorService</tt> interface and allows
you to recursively break down work to better utilize multiple
processors. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/forkjoin.html">
Fork/Join</a> (Java Tutorial). Also, the
<tt><em>&lt;Java_home&gt;</em>/sample/forkjoin</tt> directory in
the JDK download bundle contains samples that demonstrate the
fork/join framework.</p>
<h3>Convenience class for generating random numbers from multiple
threads</h3>
<p>The <tt>java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom</tt> class has
been added to make it easy to generate random numbers in
applications that require random numbers from multiple threads, or
from the fork/join mechanism.</p>
<p>The use of existing random number generator classes often ends
up unwittingly being the source of contention between threads,
biasing benchmark results. This new mechanism results in less
contention and better performance. For more information, see
<a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/threadlocalrandom.html">
Concurrent Random Numbers</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="security" id="security">Security</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The JDK 7 release incorporates many new security enhancements.
The following list shows some of these new features.</p>
<h3>Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</h3>
<p>A new native provider has been added to the JDK 7 release that
provides several ECC-based algorithms (ECDSA/ECDH). Having an ECC
provider also enables ECC-based JSSE ciphersuites on all platforms.
Previously, only platforms with a native PKCS11 ECC implementation
(e.g. Solaris) could use ECC-based ciphersuites out of the box. For
more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SunEC">
SunEC Provider's Supported Algorithms</a> in the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html">
Java Cryptography Architecture Oracle Providers Documentation</a>
(JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>CertPath and TLS algorithm disabling</h3>
<p>Weak cryptographic algorithms can now be disabled. The JDK 7
release provides a mechanism for denying the use of specific
algorithms in certification path processing and TLS handshaking.
For example, the MD2 digest algorithm is no longer considered
secure. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/certpath/CertPathProgGuide.html#AppD">
Appendix D: Disabling Cryptographic Algorithms</a>.</p>
<h3>Support for TLS 1.1</h3>
<p>The SunJSSE provider now supports TLS 1.1 as described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4346.txt">RFC 4346</a>. The
most important update is protection against cipher block chaining
(CBC) attacks.</p>
<h3>Support for TLS 1.2</h3>
<p>The SunJSSE provider now supports TLS 1.2 as described in
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5246.txt">RFC 5246</a>. Among
other things, it specifies different internal hashing algorithms,
adds new cipher suites, and contains improved flexibility,
particularly for negotiation of cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<h3>TLS renegotiation</h3>
<p>As of JDK 7, Java SE supports <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5746.txt">RFC 5746</a>, which fixes a
renegotiation issue in the TLS protocol. For more information, see
<a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#tlsRenegotiation">
Transport Layer Security (TLS) Renegotiation Issue</a> (JDK 7
Guides).</p>
<h3>Connection-sensitive trust management</h3>
<p>Both trust managers and key managers now have the ability to
examine parameters of the TLS connection, specifically the
<tt>SSLSession</tt> under construction, during the handshake. For
example, a trust manager might restrict the types of certificates
used based on the list of valid signature algorithms.</p>
<h3>Tighter checking of EncryptedPreMasterSecret version
numbers</h3>
<p>The JDK 7 release tightens version number checking during TLS
1.1 and TLS 1.2 handshaking. For more information, see the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#premasterChecking">
JSSE Reference Guide</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Server name indication (SNI) for JSSE client</h3>
<p>The JDK 7 release supports the Server Name Indication (SNI)
extension in the JSSE client. SNI, described in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4366.txt">RFC 4366</a> enables TLS
clients to connect to virtual servers.</p>
<h3>SSLv2Hello disabled by default on clients</h3>
<p>As of the JDK 7 release, SSLv2Hello is removed from the
default-enabled client protocol list.</p>
<h3>NTLM is supported</h3>
<p>The NTLM authentication protocol is now supported as a SASL
mechanism on both the client and server side. Only the
authentication layer is implemented, and there is no privacy or
integration protection in communication.</p>
<h3>Use of keytab file</h3>
<p>Java now reads a keytab file whenever that keytab file changes.
The file can be empty or non-existent when the application that
uses the file is started.</p>
<h3>JGSS default configuration file</h3>
<p>A default configuration file is now provided for JGSS with
default krb5.conf settings for Windows and *nix systems. This makes
deploying a JGSS/krb5 program very easy, especially for deploying
Java applets.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="io" id="io">IO and NIO</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The file I/O mechanism was completely reworked in the JDK 7
release. The previous mechanism, built around the
<tt>java.io.File</tt> class, is still available, but the new
mechanism, built around the <tt>java.nio.Path</tt> and
<tt>java.nio.Files</tt> classes, offers more robust file I/O and
much greater functionality.</p>
<p>For those unable to migrate to the NIO.2 file I/O at this time,
JDK 7 offers a bridge from the older API so that the new API can be
used. For more information on the <tt>Files.toPath</tt> method and
other legacy considerations, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/legacy.html">
Legacy File I/O Code</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<p>The following list highlights the improved functionality offered
by the <tt>java.nio</tt> package.</p>
<h3>More comprehensive support for file metadata</h3>
<p>Part of the new file I/O mechanism is the
<tt>java.nio.file.attribute</tt> package &ndash; this package
provides powerful support for file metadata. This package includes
support for accessing file permissions, the file's owner, and
security attributes. Accessing a file's metadata is implemented in
an efficient manner. If you want to define your own metadata, you
can use the <tt>UserDefinedFileAttributeView</tt> interface. For
more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileAttr.html">
Managing Metadata (File and File Store Attributes</a> (Java
Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Support for symbolic links</h3>
<p>In the past, there was no real support for symbolic links. For
example, it was not previously possible to write reliable code to
recursively walk a file tree and respond appropriately when the
file system contained circular symbolic links. As of JDK 7,
symbolic link support is build in - the <tt>Path</tt> and
<tt>Files</tt> classes are "link aware." You determine how you want
to handle symbolic links, and how to handle those error cases where
circular links exist. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/links.html">
Links, Symbolic or Otherwise</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Scalable file I/O support</h3>
<p>Many of the <tt>java.io.file</tt> methods did not scale.
Requesting a large directory listing over a server could result in
a hang. Large directories could also cause memory resource
problems, resulting in a denial of service. The new file I/O
package is implemented so that it works regardless of the file
system's size.</p>
<h3>Behavior is now consistent across platforms</h3>
<p>Historically, some methods did not work the same across
platforms. For example, the <tt>java.io.File.renameTo</tt> method
behaved differently on different platforms. This type of
inconsistency has been eliminated in the new
<tt>java.nio.Files</tt> file I/O APIs.</p>
<h3>Support for walking the file tree</h3>
<p>The new <tt>FileVisitor</tt> API provides easy-to-implement
support for recursively walking the file tree. This functionality
allows you to examine, modify, or delete files or directories in
the file system. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/walk.html">
Walking the File Tree</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Searching the file system</h3>
<p>The <tt>PathMatcher</tt> API provides programmatic support for
finding files on the file system. You can use the provided "glob"
syntax, regular expressions, or define your own matching code. For
more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/find.html">
Finding Files</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Watching a directory for changes</h3>
<p>The <tt>Watch Service</tt> api allows you to register a
directory for file change notifications. An application can
register for creation, deletion, or modification events. This
feature can be implemented using the <tt>FileVisitor</tt> API to
recursively watch an entire file tree for changes. For more
information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html">
Watching a Directory for Changes</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>

<h2><a name="network" id="network">Networking</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3>Supporting updated implementations of libraries from a JAR
file</h3>
<p>Prior to the JDK 7 release, if a jar file was updated, it was
difficult to ensure that the latest was being used by an
application. New in JDK 7, the <tt>URLClassLoader.close()</tt>
method eliminates the problem of supporting an updated
implementation of classes and resources loaded from JAR files. For
more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/ClassLoader.html">
Closing a URLClassLoader</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Infiniband support</h3>
<p>The new Sockets Direct Protocol (sdp) supports high throughput,
streamed connections over Infiniband fabric. SDP is supported only
on Solaris and Linux. For more information, see <a href=

<hr />
<h2><a name="i18n" id="i18n">Internationalization</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ability to use Unicode 6.0.0</h3>
<p>The JDK 7 release supports the Unicode 6.0.0 standard, which
added support for over 10,000 additional characters, as well as
support for properties and data files. The Java Tutorial has a new
section that discusses <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/unicode.html">
Unicode</a>.</p>
<h3>Extensible support for ISO 4217 currency codes</h3>
<p>Currencies are identified by their <a href=
"http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/popstds/currencycodes.html">
ISO 4217 codes</a>. The JDK 7 release makes it possible to
accommodate new currencies without requiring a new release of the
JDK. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/enhancements.7.html">
Extensible Support for ISO 4217 Currency Codes</a> (JDK 7

<h3>Category locale support</h3>
<p>The default locale can be independently set for two types of
uses: the <em>format</em> setting is used for formatting resources,
and the <em>display</em> setting is used in menus and dialogs.
Programmatic support so that these locale types can be set
independently. On Windows, these default values are initialized
according to the "Standards and Formats" and "Display Language"
settins in the control panel. For more information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/enhancements.7.html">
Category Locale Support</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Updated <tt>Locale</tt> support</h3>
<p>The <tt>Locale</tt> class has been updated. There is new support
for industry standards, such as IETF BCP 47 (Tags for Identifying
Languages) and UTS#35 (Unicode Locale Data Markup Language). A
<tt>Locale.Builder</tt> convenience class has been added to make it
easier to create a <tt>Locale</tt> object. The ability to add
user-defined extensions to a locale, for example to specify the
linux platform, or a particular release. For information on other
updates, see <a href=

<h3>New support for shaping numeric characters</h3>
<p>The <tt>NumericShaper</tt> class, used to convert Latin-1 digits
to other Unicode decimal digits, has been enhanced to make it
easier to shape digits. For more information, see <a href=

<h3>Ability to change how components are drawn and how they respond
to events</h3>
<p>The new <tt>JLayer</tt> class provides a powerful framework so
that you can change the look of a component and how it behaves. For
example, you can use JLayer (and related) classes to create an
animated wait indicator over a panel. You can use it to visually
indicate when a text field contains valid data. You can make a
panel ignore, temporarily, all mouse clicks outside of its borders.

<p>Prior to JDK 7, mixing heavyweight (AWT) and lightweight (Swing)
components in the same container has been problematic. As of JDK 7,
this can be easily accomplished. For more information, see <a href=
"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/mixing-components-433992.html">

<h3>Creating shaped and translucent windows</h3>
<p>The JDK 7 release supports creating windows with transparency
(both uniform and per-pixel transparency) and also non-rectangular
windows. For more information, see <a href=

Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Improved 2D rendering</h3>
<p>Introduced in JDK 7, a new XRender-based Java 2D rendering
pipeline is provided for modern X11-based desktops. This pipeline,
which offers improved graphics performance, is disabled by default,
but may be enabled via the command line property
<tt>-Dsun.java2d.xrender=true</tt>. Older X11 configurations may
not be able to support XRender. For more information, see <a href=

<h3>Support for OpenType/CFF fonts</h3>
<p>As of JDK 7, installed OpenType/CFF fonts are enumerated and
displayed through methods such as <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/GraphicsEnvironment.html#getAvailableFontFamilyNames()">
<tt>GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames</tt></a>. These
fonts are also recognized by the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Font.html#createFont(int,%20java.io.InputStream)">
<tt>Font.createFont</tt></a> method.</p>
<h3>Support for Tibetan script</h3>
<p>New in JDK 7 is text rendering support of the Tibetan
script.</p>
<h3>Support for Linux and Solaris 11 fonts</h3>
<p>Historically, the logical fonts for the JDK were statically
specified in a <tt>fontconfig.properties</tt> file. However, on the
various implementations of Linux, there is no consistency in the
presence of fonts. So, without custom files, Asian (CJK) text, etc,
would not be rendered. In JDK 7, on Linux, and for Solaris 11, in
the absence of a customized <tt>fontconfig.properties</tt> file for
the OS version, the default behavior is to use the system
<tt>libfontconfig</tt> to select fonts to use for the logical
fonts. In this case, the logical fonts will reflect the fonts used
by the Gnome/KDE desktop applications which use the same platform
library. For more information, see <a href=
"http://www.fontconfig.org/">Fontconfig</a> on <a href=
"http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Providing HSL color selection</h3>
<p>An HSV tab has been added to the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JColorChooser.html">
<tt>JColorChooser</tt></a> class. This feature allows users to
select colors using the Hue-Saturation-Luminance (HSL) color model
and is available automatically in JDK 7.</p>

<h2><a name="javadb" id="javadb">Java DB Enhancements</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>The version of Java DB bundled with JDK 7 introduces many
improvements over the version bundled with JDK 6. New features
include:</p>
<h3>Definer's rights</h3>
<p>Procedures and functions can now run with their creators'
privileges, rather than with the current user's permissions.</p>
<h3>BOOLEAN data type</h3>
<p><tt>BOOLEAN</tt> is now a legal data type for columns, routine
arguments, and function return values.</p>
<h3>Table truncation</h3>
<p>A new <tt>TRUNCATE TABLE</tt> command drops all rows in a table
quickly.</p>
<h3>Query plan browsing</h3>
<p>A new <tt>PlanExporter</tt> tool helps developers visualize
query plans better.</p>
<h3>Unicode database names</h3>
<p>Remote clients can now use database names which include Unicode
characters outside of the ASCII codeset.</p>
<h3>Automatic calculation of index statistics</h3>
<p>Java DB automatically refreshes statistics to help it pick
better query plans.</p>
<h3>Improved interrupt handling</h3>
<p>Interrupting connection threads no longer crashes the Java DB
engine.</p>
<h3>MAX optimization</h3>
<p>On indexed tables, <tt>MAX</tt> queries run faster in more
cases.</p>
<h3>XML operator portability</h3>
<p>The <tt>xmlparse</tt> and <tt>xmlserialize</tt> operators work
out-of-the-box on more platforms.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="xml" id="xml">Java XML Technology
Enhancements</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>As of the JDK 7 release, several XML technologies were folded
into the Java SE platform and the supported versions of those
technologies updated.</p>
<h3>Java API for XML Processing (JAXP)</h3>
<p>The JDK 7 release now supports JAXP 1.4.5. There have been many
bug fixes and some improvements over the previous version of JAXP,
particularly in the areas of conformance, security, and
performance. The specification is still JAXP 1.4, however StAX has
been upgraded to StAX 1.2 in accordance with the JSR 173
Maintenance Review 3. For more information, see <a href=
"http://jaxp.java.net/1.4/1.4.5/ReleaseNotes.html">JAXP 1.4.5
Release Notes</a> and the <a href=
"http://jaxp.java.net/1.4/1.4.5/changelog.html">JAXP 1.4.5 Change
log</a>.</p>
<h3>Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)</h3>
<p>JDK 7 now supports JAXB 2.2.3. For more information, see the
<a href=
"http://jaxb.java.net/nonav/2.2.3u1/docs/changelog2.html">JAXB
Change log</a> for JAXB RI 2.2 and above.</p>
<h3>Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS)</h3>
<p>JDK 7 now supports JAX-WS 2.2.4. For more information, see the
<a href="http://jax-ws.java.net/">JAX-WS Change log</a> for JAX-WS
RI 2.2 and above.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a name="deploy" id="deploy">Deployment Enhancements</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ability to load applet in a single network request</h3>
<p>To load a web page containing an applet, the JNLP file and the
jar file (at a minimum) has to be loaded. Introduced in the JDK 7
release, a copy of the JNLP file can be cached in the HTML page.
This reduces the minimum number of network requests that are needed
to start the applet and the applet is quicker to launch. For more
information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/embeddingJNLPFileInWebPage.html">
Embedding JNLP File in Applet Tag</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Attempt to access applet from JavaScript may block if applet is
not yet initialized</h3>
<p>Most browsers use single-threaded JavaScript engines so, when
the applet is accessed before the applet's <tt>init</tt> method has
completed, it appears that the host page, and the browser, are
frozen. Prior to JDK 7, there was no easy way to check if the
applet was ready to be accessed. Introduced in JDK 7 is an applet
<tt>status</tt> property. You can check the applet's
<tt>status</tt> anytime to determine whether it is ready to accept
requests. Alternatively, you can use callback functions to receive
notification when an applet is ready. This feature mitigates the
blocking behavior of the <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/applet/Applet.html#isActive%28%29">
<tt>isActive()</tt></a> api and does not rely on waiting for the
applet's <tt>init</tt> method to complete before providing a
status. This feature is enabled by setting the
<tt>java_status_events</tt> parameter to <tt>true</tt>. For more
information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/appletStatus.html">
Handling Initialization Status With Event Handlers</a> (Java
Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Codebase in webstart JNLP file can be optional with Deployment
toolkit</h3>
<p>Prior to JDK 7, moving a JNLP application to another location
required editing the <tt>codebase</tt> value in the JNLP file. This
was especially complicated for signed JNLP files that are embedded
into jar files. As of JDK 7, if you deploy a JNLP webstart
application via the Deployment toolkit APIs, it is possible to omit
specifying the <tt>codebase</tt> in the JNLP file. Therefore, if
you move the JNLP file to a new location, you no longer have to
edit the file to embed that new location. For more information, see
<a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/deploymentInDepth/deployingWithoutCodebase.html">
Deploying Without Codebase</a> (Java Tutorial).</p>
<h3>Ability to partially sign a JNLP file</h3>
<p>A signed JNLP file is used to ensure than an application launch
descriptor can not be modified externally. Before JDK 7, a signed
JNLP file had to match the external bootstrap copy exactly. That
made it difficult to redistribute an application or tune its
deployment without rebuilding it. Now the developer can use a
template to define what parts of an external JNLP file may differ
from one embedded into a jar file.</p>
<h3>Targeting resources to a particular version of the OS</h3>
<p>Prior to JDK 7, it was possible to target a resource to a
particular "family" of operating systems, such as
<tt>os="linux"</tt>. This feature is now more finely grained, so
that a particular version of the OS can be specified. For example,
<tt>os="Windows\ Vista Windows\ 7"</tt>. For more information, see
the <tt>os</tt> attribute for the <tt>information</tt> and
<tt>resources</tt> elements in <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html">
JNLP File Syntax</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Defining the install preferences of an application</h3>
<p>In the JDK 7 release, an <tt>install</tt> attribute for the
<tt>shortcut</tt> element has been added. You can use this optional
attribute to specify the application's preference for being
considered "installed." On Windows, this determines if the
application appears in the Add or Remove Programs panel. For more
information, see <a href=
"http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javaws/developersguide/syntax.html">
JNLP File Syntax</a> (JDK 7 Guides).</p>
<h3>Better control over applet decoration settings</h3>
<p>Before the JDK 7 release, an applet launched from a desktop
shortcut was always decorated, but the same applet, when dragged
out of the browser, was always undecorated. As of JDK 7, this
behavior can be specified in the JNLP file and the same settings
will be used both for drag out and a shortcut launch. The default
behavior does not change. For more information, see <a href=
